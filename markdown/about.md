* [Crisis *&* Opportunity]{.smallcaps} seeks to reprint foundational work in the field of sociology. The focus is on articles that can provide valuable insights both into understanding the development of sociology but also our analysis of contemporary social issues.  
* The name [Crisis *&* Opportunity]{.smallcaps} is inspired by two prominent periodicals in the early part of the twentieth century edited by Black sociologists. W.E. B. Du Bois founded *The Crisis*, the official journal of the NAACP, in 1910 and was its editor until 1934. Charles S. Johnson, sociologist and later president of Fisk University, edited *Opportunity*, the official journal of the National Urban League, founded by George Edmund Haynes, later a sociology professor at Fisk.
* Artwork on the homepage is created with variations on the prompt "abstract Harlem renaissance woodcut style of Aaron Douglas" using OpenAI's Dall-E.
* Each of the works on this site is believed to be in the public domain. Feel free to copy, share, repurpose, and remix. If you think we've made a mistake, let [me](neal.caren@unc.edu) know.
* [Crisis *&* Opportunity]{.smallcaps} is edited by [Neal Caren](https://nealcaren.org).
