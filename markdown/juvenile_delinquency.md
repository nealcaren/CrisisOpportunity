When we turn to the study of juvenile delinquency we find, as in the
case of desertions and illegitimacy, that Negroes furnish a
disproportionate number of cases in most cities for which statistics are
available. In New York City the proportion of Negro children arraigned
in the Children's Court increased from 4.2 per cent in 1919 to 8 per
cent in 1925, although the Negro population was only 2.7 per cent of the
total in 1920.^[*A Study of Delinquent and Neglected Children before the New York City
Children's Court in 1925*, Joint Committee on Negro Child Study (New
York, 1927), p. 6.] In Indianapolis, Gary, and Dayton the proportion of
Negro cases was from three to four times as large as their relative
numbers in the population. Likewise, in three southern cities, Richmond,
Memphis, and Charleston, South Carolina, Negroes furnished about one and
a half times as large a proportion of the delinquency cases as their
relative numbers in the population of these cities.^[See T. J. Woofter, Jr., *Negro Problems in Cities* (New York, 1928), p. 227.]

Juvenile delinquency among the Negroes of Chicago has shown the same
tendency as in other northern cities. Since 1900 there has been an
increase in the proportion of Negro cases. This increase has been most
marked since the migrations from the South during and since the World
War. In 1925 nearly a fifth of the boys and girls brought into the
Juvenile Court were Negroes. Not all of the cases of juvenile
delinquency were brought into the court. In 1926 there were 1,322 Negro
boys arrested for juvenile delinquency,

[205]{.pagenum}

although only 320 cases were taken to the court. In 1927 the number of
arrests had increased to 1,503.^[In the city of Chicago practically all complaints alleging juvenile
delinquency come to the attention of the juvenile police probation
officers who are assigned to the Juvenile Court by the superintendent of
the Police Department and are under the direction of a lieutenant of
police in the Juvenile Court Building. In 1926 there were twenty-eight
such officers assigned to the forty police districts of the city. When a
complaint is made at the police station or the child is 'picked up' by a
police officer, the case is referred to the police probation officer of the district. This officer may dispose of the case either with or without court action. The juvenile police
probation officers' records showed 9,243 individual boys against
whom complaints alleging delinquency were made during the year 1926"
(Clifford R. Shaw, *Delinquency Areas* \[Chicago, 1929\], p. 53).
The statistics which form the basis of this chapter were taken from
the records of the Institute for Juvenile Research. See Table XVI,
Appendix B.]

The increase in the number of Negro delinquents has followed the
movement of the Negro population into the areas

![Chart XII](Images/chart_xii.png)


which have been characterized by a high delinquency rate. Clifford R.
Shaw says in this connection:

> The white Protestants, most of whom are native born, have in the process
of the growth of Chicago, gradually moved out of the areas of
deterioration where the rate of delinquency is high. The Negro on the
[206]{.pagenum} other hand, because of his lower economic status, has tended to move
into the area of deterioration near the "Loop," thus supplanting to a
certain extent the white Protestant population in this area. The
increase in the percentage of the Negro cases brought to court may be
due to some extent to the type of area in which this racial group is
forced to live.^[Shaw and Myers, *The Illinois Crime Survey*, p. 670. The
percentage of German and Irish cases brought to court has decreased
since 1900 while the percentage of Polish cases, like the Negro
cases, has increased *(ibid.,* p. 667).]]

| Year  | 1900 | 1905 | 1910 | 1915 | 1920 | 1925 | 1930 |
|-------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| Boys  | 4.7  | 5.1  | 5.5  | 6.2  | 9.9  | 17.1 | 21.7 |

The high delinquent rate which has characterized the area near the Loop,
where a large part of the Negro population has found a foothold in the city, has existed over a period of
thirty years "notwithstanding the fact that the (racial) composition has
changed markedly."^[Clifford R. Shaw, *op. cit*., p. 203.]



Moreover, Shaw's studies of delinquency have indicated that there were
variations in the rates of delinquency for
[209]{.pagenum} 
different sections of the Negro community. In computing rates of
delinquency for one-mile intervals along the main thoroughfares
radiating from the Loop, he found that the decline in rates along the
radial passing through the area occupied by the Negro population was
similar to that in the case of other radials.^[Clifford R. Shaw, "Correlation of Rate of Juvenile Delinquency with
    Certain Indices of Community Organization and Disorganization,"
    *Publications of the American Sociological Society*, XXII (1928),
    174-79\* Shaw did not calculate the delinquency rates for the
    Negroes separately but for the entire population, which for the area
    through which the State Street radial passed was made up principally
    of Negroes.] Variations in the rates
of juvenile delinquency in the Negro population, when studied alone,
were brought out when the Negro cases were distributed in the community
and rates worked out for the seven zones into which we have divided the
community. The variations in the rates of delinquency showed the same
trend, which we have found in the case of dependency, desertions,
illegitimacy, and other indexes of family and social disorganization.^[The distribution of Negro boys brought before the Juvenile Court
    from January 1, 1923, to June 1, 1924, and Negro boys arrested for
    Juvenile delinquency during the years 1926 and 1927, according to
    census tracts and zones, is shown in Table XVI, Appendix B. The
    statistics for boys brought before the Juvenile Court were taken
    from a map prepared in the social research laboratory of the Local
    Community Research Committee at the University of Chicago.
    Statistics for arrests for juvenile delinquency and men in the
    County Jail were secured from the materials collected by the
    Institute for Juvenile Research. The addresses of boys arrested
    during 1926 were spotted on maps (see Maps XII and XIII). In some
    cases the boys were arrested as often as six times. The frequency of
    arrests is indicated by variations in the symbols.]
Moreover, the decline in the rates of juvenile delinquency showed a
trend similar to the variations in the rates of adult delinquency in
these areas.

[209]{.pagenum} 
In the first zone near the "Loop," where deterioration and the
encroachment of business and industry were forcing the
[210]{.pagenum} 
Negro families further south, the thirty-three boys who were arrested
for juvenile delinquency in 1926 represented over two-fifths of the boys
from ten to seventeen years of age in the area. In this same area 10 per
cent of the adult Negro males were in the County Jail in 1921.^[*i.e.*, males seventeen to forty-four years of age.] The
next three zones showed only a slight improvement over the first in
regard to juvenile delinquency.^[The rate of delinquency for the first zone might have been
exaggerated since a small error in the estimation of the population for
1926 would greatly increase the delinquency rate in the small population
of this area.] Three boys out of ten in these areas
were arrested for juvenile delinquency and some of these boys were
arrested three and four times during the year.


[TABLE XXI. Percentage of Adult Males in County Jail and Percentage of Boys Ten to
Seventeen Years of Age Arrested for Juvenile Delinquency in the Seven
Zones of the South Side Negro Community, Chicago]{.caption}

|                                        | Zone I | Zone II | Zone III | Zone IV | Zone V | Zone VI | Zone VII |
|----------------------------------------|--------|---------|----------|---------|--------|---------|----------|
| Males in County Jail: 1921             | 9.4    | 6.7     | 3.8      | 2.5     | 2.9    | 3.2     | 1.2      |
| Arrests for juvenile delinquency: 1926 | 42.8   | 31.4    | 30.0     | 28.8    | 15.7   | 9.6     | 1.4      |

A decided decrease in the delinquency rate appeared in the fifth zone
where police probation officers had complaints against 15 per cent of
the boys. In the sixth zone, as in the case of family desertion and
illegitimacy, the delinquency rate continued to decline sharply, and in
the seventh zone less than 2 per cent of the boys had complaints brought
against them for delinquency.^[For the period, January 1, 1923, to June 1, 1924, only two boys from
the sixth zone and none from the seventh zone were brought before the
Juvenile Court. During the same period, Roseland and Englewood were also
    free from Juvenile Court cases. Morgan Park had only three cases.
    See Table XVI, Appendix B.]


[211]{.pagenum}
The highest rates of juvenile delinquency were in those areas of the
Negro community which were characterized, as we have seen, by
deterioration and social disorganization. In these areas the customary
forms of social control in the Negro group tended to decay, family
discipline disappeared, especially in the case of the many broken homes,
and even the well-organized families lost much of their influence over
the behavior of the children.^[In a recent study of delinquent and neglected Negro children in
New York City it was shown that the most common charges against the
boys were disorderly conduct and the desertion of home and in the
cases of the girls approximately 85 per cent of them were charged
with desertion of home and ungovernable and wayward conduct, while,
among the whites, stealing and burglary were the most common charges
(*Study Delinquent and Neglected Children before the New York City Children's Court in 1925,* Joint Committee on Negro Child Study
\[New York, 1927\], p. 6).] Many of the boys took over from
other boys and gangs the patterns of delinquent behavior that
characterized these areas. The vicious and delinquent patterns of
behavior, which have become traditional in the sections of cities where
large numbers of Negroes are generally forced to live, are often
transmitted to the stable Negro families. A Negro social worker from a
good family background wrote the following concerning the influence of
the vicious behavior, in the community where she was reared, on her
younger sisters, one of whom became delinquent.

> When our neighborhood began to be more thickly populated it became known
as the "red light district" for white sporting people. As the city grew
they were always being forced farther out and as this was the edge of
the city they were permitted to live in this vicinity. I remember when
my mother would go away from home my sisters would make believe they
were sporting people and roll up newspapers
[212]{.pagenum}
and pretend they were smoking cigarettes and even try to imitate their
language by swearing.^[Manuscript document.]

The case of a delinquent boy in the third zone shows the relationship
between the family situation and the community background and the high
delinquency rate in this area. We give first the following brief summary
of the boy's delinquent career:

> In March, 1926, M&#11834; T&#11834;, 12 years 7 months, was arraigned
with three other boys older than himself for breaking into a fish market
at 33 South State Street one evening in January. They entered
the market by breaking the glass in the rear door and secured a watch
and steel revolver, besides damaging the telephone box. They gave
the watch and revolver to a man named G&#11834; who was supposed to
room at 31 Prairie Avenue. This man promised to pay them but
did not. They also admitted burglarizing a flat on West 36th Street
where they got a watch and a revolver. They sold the watch to
A&#11834; A&#11834; , 11 years old, and the gun to L&#11834; J&#11834; , 15 years old,
getting \$1.00 for each. The case was continued until the father of one
of the boys could be secured. In October M&#11834; T&#11834; was arrested in
Gary and charged with the larceny of an automobile. He had been a source
of trouble during his parole in Chicago. His mother brought him to the
Juvenile Court and asked that he be placed in the Detention Home. He was
sent there but escaped after two attempts. He was caught and returned a
week later and sent to St. Charles School for Boys. In May, 1927, he was
again sent to St. Charles for attempted burglary of a Standard Oil
Station. In each case he was in the company of the same boys. In
January, 1930, he was arrested on suspicion for attempting to rob a meat
truck but was released on February 2nd. He was returned home but left
within a few hours and was not heard from again until February 10th when
he was shot through the arm while he and five others were attempting to
hold up a store. He was sent to the Bridewell.^[The writer is indebted for the information in this case to Mr.
Earl R. Moses, who has made an intensive study of delinquent Negro
boys in Chicago.]


[213]{.pagenum}
The boy, M&#11834;, was born in Jackson, Mississippi, in
1913 and was taken to Washington, D.C., when he was five years old.
After the family, consisting of his father, mother, two sisters, and a
brother, all three younger than himself, had remained in Washington six
years, they came to Chicago. The father was employed at unskilled work
while the mother engaged in day work. Neither parent was at home from
six in the morning until five-thirty in the afternoon. The mother told
the following story of the beginning of the boy's delinquencies soon
after coming to Chicago.

> We were living at and there was a boy who used to come
over to see M&#11834;. Him and this boy was great friends so one day---
one Sunday it was, I had gone to church and was on my way back and when
they saw me coming they ran. I had about fifteen dollars in a little
bank and they had thrown it out of the back window in the alley
and ran down the stairs and got it and went off. Of course M&#11834; says
the other boy did it so the boy's mamma gave me his part back. That
was about a year after we came to Chicago and ever since then M&#11834;
has been doing something. He has a gang of boys that he goes around with
and I can't do anything with him. He began when he was about twelve
years old to stay away from home and school. I would send him to school
and he would even go to school but jest as soon as that gang, what he
would run around with, would come by and whistle he would get an excuse
and leave. I did not know this until one day I was going over to my
sister's house and I saw him and a whole bunch of boys going under the
tressel when I thought he was at school. Well then, I walks fast and
catches him and takes him home and got after him about running away from
school and he said that the boys came by for him and he went. I then
goes to the school and asks the teacher about him and she said that he
had been staying out of school for a long time and whenever he did come,
and she would ask him where he had been, he would tell her that his
mother had kept him out to go places for her and there I didn't even
know that he had not been to school. When we first came to Chicago and M&#11834;
would be out late in the
[214]{.pagenum}
night playing, I told Mr. T&#11834; that he ought not to let M&#11834; stay
out so late playing around with these boys here and he would say "0 let
the boy play."^[Unpublished document.]

There are several important factors that should be noted concerning the
origin of the boy's delinquency. The absence of both father and mother
from the home during the greater part of the day prevented the
development of common interests and the sharing of a common experience.
There was a difference of opinion, which led to conflict, between the
parents themselves over the restrictions that should be placed on the
boy's playing at night. The attempt of the father by the use of severe
corporal punishment to force the boy to remain at home and to attend
school regularly only accentuated his dislike of home and opposition to
parental control. As the younger brother told the investigator:
"You know the reason M&#11834; don't come home? Papa used
to whip him every time he would stay off. Mamma says that is what is the
matter now. He never whips me much because I don't do anything but go to
school." The younger brother's statement was confirmed by the mother in
the presence of the father. When the latter excused his whipping the boy
severely because he wanted him to stay at home and go to school, adding,
"I'd give anything if he'd just do that; so that's why I whipped him. I
tried to get him to see it that way but I could not," the mother
replied:

> Yes, but there was no need to kill him because you couldn't get him your
way after he had already gone wrong. Honest its the truth,
sometimes Mr. T&#11834; wouldn't even know that I was out of bed---out
in the cold and snow looking for M&#11834; and he would be home sleeping
without a care, it seems, and as soon as I would get the child home and
call him and tell him I had found our boy, he would jump up and go to
beating him. Why he got so bad at it until even our neighbors
[215]{.pagenum}
would tell me to ask him not to beat the child so much but to talk to
him some and maybe that would help. I tried to tell him that myself but
it didn't do any good. Why it was awful, he got so bad until he even hit
me one night because I tried to stop him and that's when I told him that
it could not go on any longer---it was too much.^[*Ibid.*]

The area in which this family had lived since coming to Chicago has long
been characterized by vice and crime. The area has deteriorated
considerably and most of the Negroes in this area live in tenements and
dilapidated two flats and frame buildings. During the little over five
years that the family has been in Chicago, they have lived in five
places in this same area. During this time the boy has been transferred
from one school to another. The constant moving about in this area is
characteristic of the families who live there. In the absence of an
attractive home environment the boy spent most of his time in the
streets. As we have noted before, this area lacks any form of
neighborhood organization or communal life. The boy became a member, at
first, of the play groups and later of an organized gang in the area and
took over the patterns of delinquent behavior that characterized these
groups.^["There is sufficient material already available to indicate rather
clearly that the spontaneous play group and the more highly organized
gang are important factors in the problem of delinquency. In a study of
six thousand stealing cases coming before the Juvenile Court of Cook
County, it was found that in 90.4 per cent of the cases two or more boys
were involved in the act. In many of these groups delinquency becomes a
traditional form of behavior and is transmitted from the older to the
younger members of the group" (Clifford R. Shaw, *The Jack-Roller*
\[Chicago, 1930\], p. 10).] It was in these groups rather than in the family group that
the boy acquired his aims and conceptions of life. This was seen in the
mother's report of the boy's opinion of one of the leaders of the gang
of which he was a member.

[216]{.pagenum}
There is a bunch of boys that he runs around with and we can not
keep him away from them. He told me that G&#11834; C&#11834; had a head
on him of which any man would be proud. M&#11834; says that boy can
take a bunch of fellows in a store and walk up to the storekeeper and go
to talking and those fellows can get anything they want. You see that's
the bunch he ran into and we simply can't stop him now.^[Unpublished document.]

Sometimes, especially in this zone, the boy's delinquency not only
reflected the criminal behavior that characterized this area but the
criminal conduct of his parents. This was the situation in the case of a
ten-year-old boy, who was first brought into court by his mother in 1924
because "he was beyond her control." About a year previously a foster
grandmother had reported the boy's mother to the court for neglect of
him and immoral conduct. As the result of the boy's truancy and
desertion of the home in 1924 he was placed in the Parental School. In
1927, when the boy was thirteen, he was brought into the court on the
charge of burglary. This charge had followed several other
delinquencies, in the company of three other boys, and detention in the
Cook County School twice and the Chicago Parental School several times.

A brief recital of some of the outstanding facts in the boy's family
background will enable one to see how his delinquent and later criminal
career grew out of the criminal behavior of his mother and
stepfather.^[In December, 1930, he was paroled the third time from St. Charles
where he had been sent on each occasion for robbery.] His mother and father were married in New Orleans in
1911, and in 1913 came to Chicago where the boy was bom the following
year. Immediately after the family migrated to the city the father
secured a job with a construction company. When he became ill the mother
was forced to take in washing and iron[217]{.pagenum}ing and do day work. She placed the child with his foster grandmother.
After the father recovered, the grandmother secured a court order
requiring him to pay her \$10 for the child's support. But the father
did not assume responsibility for the family and left the city. In 1923
the father was placed in a sanitarium where he died in March leaving the
family without any money. The mother married again the following year.
Soon after she was forced to work she discovered that she could find
less laborious and more profitable means of making a living by selling
narcotics and engaging in other criminal practices characteristic of
this zone. When her trade in narcotics was broken up by the police, she
wandered about the country to escape arrest. She was finally arrested in
Chicago, but escaped imprisonment, according to her story, by paying out
a large sum. She then began to sell liquor. When this was also broken up
by the police, she began to sell "policy," a lottery scheme popular in
some sections of the Negro community. The boy has been mixed up in his
mother's criminal career helping her, especially, to sell "policy." The
mother's attitude toward the boy's delinquency has been simply that her
son should wait until he is older in order that he can carry on criminal
practices in a more systematic way and escape detection. As she
said: "If &#11834;(her son) would just wait awhile 'till he gets
older, I would get him in the racket and we would all be settin' pretty.
He is out with my policy books now and I don't know whether I am going
to get them back or not." The decline in delinquency for the last three
zones at the southern end of the Negro community accompanied the
progressive stabilization of family life, the decrease in social
disorganization, and a growth in communal life. In the seventh zone from
which boys were seldom brought into
[218]{.pagenum}
the court and where there were only five arrests for delinquency in
1926, the large number of home-owning families representing the higher
occupational classes in the Negro community have endeavored to keep the
area free from disorder through their neighborhood organization. But the
poorer and more disorganized families have gradually filtered in from
the other areas and delinquency has been on the increase. In 1927
complaints were brought against sixteen boys and other signs of disorder
had begun to appear.

Negroes in Chicago, as in many cities, contribute a disproportionate
amount of juvenile delinquency. In the case of Chicago, juvenile
delinquency among Negroes has been increasing especially since the World
War. It has increased as Negroes have moved into those areas of Chicago
which have been distinguished by a high rate of juvenile delinquency for
a period of thirty years, in spite of marked changes in the racial
composition of these areas during this period. This fact indicates the
close relationship between the community situation and juvenile
delinquency. This relationship was further emphasized by the fact that
the rates of delinquency showed wide variations in the Negro community.
It was high in the areas of deterioration where the poorer migrants from
the South settled chiefly and in the area which was distinguished by
crime, vice, and other forms of social disorganization. The rate of
delinquency decreased considerably for the successive zones marking the
expansion of the Negro community. In the seventh zone, where the higher
occupational classes were concentrated and normal family groups occupied
single-family houses, many of which they owned, juvenile delinquency in
the Negro population tended to disappear. While the areas of high
delinquency rates were differentiated from the areas
[219]{.pagenum}
of low rates in regard to their physical character, the occupational
status and the literacy of their inhabitants, home ownership,
dependency, family desertion and non-support, and illegitimacy, these
differences reflected fundamental differences in culture in the Negro
group. For in no respect were these areas more sharply differentiated
than in regard to family tradition, or in respect to the extent to which
the culture of one generation was transmitted to the succeeding
generation.
