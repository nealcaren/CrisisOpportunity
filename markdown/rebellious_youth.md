The disorganization of Negro family life in the urban environment,
together with the absence of communal controls, results in a high
delinquency rate among Negro boys and girls. However, among Negroes, as
among whites, boys are much more frequently brought before the courts
than girls. For example, in 1933 there were 9,864 Negro boys as compared
with 1,803 Negro girls dealt with in delinquency cases disposed of by
sixty-seven courts in the United States,^[U.S. Department of Labor, *Juvenile Court Statistics and Federal Juvenile Offenders* (Children's Bureau Pub. 232 \[Washington, 1936\]),
p. 29. Only 67 of the 255 courts reporting delinquency furnished
information on color.] not including the 283 boys
and 8 girls whose cases were disposed of by federal authorities.^[*Ibid.,* p. 81.]
Since the misconduct of Negro girls has been considered to some extent
in connection with the problem of unmarried motherhood, our attention
here will be directed mainly to the misconduct of Negro boys which may
be dealt with under the law.^[As defined in the report of the Committee on Socially Handicapped-Delinquency, of the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection, "delinquency is any such juvenile misconduct as might be dealt with under the law" (*The Delinquent Child* \[New York, 1932\], p.
23).]

Negro boys and girls are younger on the whole than the white boys and
girls handled by the courts. In the sixty- seven courts for which we
have records in 1933, 87 per cent of the Negro boys and 84 per cent of
the Negro girls as compared with 79 per cent of the white boys and 69
per
[359]{.pagenum}
cent of the white girls were under sixteen years of age.^[U.S. Department of Labor, *op. cit.,* p. 29.] Moreover,
available studies indicate that the rates of delinquency for both Negro
boys and Negro girls are distinctly higher than for white boys and
girls. For example, in New York City the Negro rate is about three times
the white rate, while in Baltimore it is more than four times the white
rate.^[*Ibid.,* p. 10; see also Sophia M. Robison, *Can Delinquency Be Measured?* (New York, 1936), pp. 62-64.] Then, if we view the situation from the standpoint of the Negro
alone, we find that in three southern cities&nbsp;--- Richmond, Memphis, and
Charleston&nbsp;--- the proportion of Negro cases has been about one and a half
times their relative numbers in the population of these cities, while in
Indianapolis, Gary, and Dayton, the proportion has reached three or four
times their relative numbers.^[See T. J. Woofter, Jr., *Negro Problem in Cities* (New York, 1928), p. 227.]

It is difficult to detect any significant trend in juvenile delinquency
among Negroes for the country as a whole. However, in certain localities
one may find fairly definite indications that the rates have mounted or
declined over a period of years.^[U.S. Department of Labor, *op. cit.,* p. 10.] In the District of Columbia the rate
has declined from 922 per 10,000 boys of juvenile court age in 1927 to
737 in 1933. During the same period the rate in Hudson County, New
Jersey, declined from 698 to 263; and in Fulton County, Georgia, from
644 to 496 for the four years 1930-33. On the other hand, in Baltimore
from 1930 to 1933 the rate rose from 672 to 962, and in New York
City it leaped from 170 in 1927 to 342 in 1928 and remained close to the
latter rate until 1933. But even the trends observable in the various
cities throw little or no light on the

[360]{.pagenum}
problem of Negro delinquency. In order to get an understanding of the
problem, it is necessary to study the delinquent boy or girl in relation
to his or her family and community setting.

The facts brought out in a study of Negro juvenile delinquency in
Nashville, Tennessee, during recent years will enable us to get some
understanding of the social factors which are responsible for
delinquency in southern cities.^[The information on Nashville is taken from a Master's thesis written under the direction of the author (see Mary LaVerta Huff, "Juvenile Delinquency in Nashville" \[Fisk University thesis (Nashville,Tenn., June, 1934)\]).]

[Number of Negro Boys and Girls Brought before the Juvenile Court,
Nashville, Tennessee, 1925-29]{.caption}

|        | 1926 | 1926 | 1927 | 1928 | 1929 |
|--------|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|
| Boys   |  210 |  169 |  186 |  200 |  176 |
| Girls  |   98 |   96 |   95 |   84 |   68 |

During the period from 1925 to 1929, the number of Negro boys brought
into the juvenile court in Nashville fluctuated considerably, whereas
the number of Negro girls declined from 98 to 68 (see Table 18). The
number of Negro delinquents brought to court during this period was only
slightly in excess of their relative numbers in the population of the
city.^[However, in 1932 the number of delinquent boys increased to 324 and the number of girls to 83. This increase might have been due to the apprehension of more delinquents when the Negro probation force was
enlarged.] In 1929 about 70 per cent of the boys and 63 per cent of the
girls were from twelve to fifteen years of age. Nearly a half of the
boys were charged with stealing; whereas the majority of the girls were
charged with incorrigibility and
[361]{.pagenum}
disorderly conduct. It should be added that these Negro delinquents were
apprehended as ordinary criminals and brought to court by the police
much more frequently than the white delinquents.

The complaint of a deputy sheriff against a ten-year-old offender gives
some notion of the demoralization of childhood represented in these
delinquency cases:

> This boy was brought in on a state warrant charging tippling and the boy
admits that he sold a pint of whisky for the people for whom he was
working, to some man he did not know, for \$1.50 and gave the money to
the people for whom he worked. H. make an investigation of the boy's
home and found conditions deplorable. The boy's mother does not live
there but at the place where she works. The boy lives with a married
sister whose home is filthy and unsanitary and an unfit place to live.
The boy does not have supervision. He will not tell the truth and is
badly in need of supervision.^[From court record.]

In the charges brought by police officers against a fifteen- year-old
boy, who was sentenced to the Children's Detention Home for a year, one
can see to what extent these homeless children in the slum areas of
southern cities are subjected to all types of vicious influences:

> The proof is that he, S.P., A.W., and two other men were all in one
bed together on Sunday morning, March 3, and were engaged in lewdness.
They admit they were guilty of lewdness. The boy is not going to school
and has not been at home in weeks. He lives in this room where the
officer caught all this lewdness at 7 a.m. The boy has heretofore been
at the C.D.H. for larceny. He is delinquent and a truant.^[From court record.]

But more often these boys are picked up for acts of theft ranging from
petty stealing to burglaries. The record of a boy only eleven years of
age charged with larceny states: 


> The [362]{.pagenum} boy's father came in court and made complaint that the boy would not
work or go to school but was stealing all around the neighborhood and
was teaching the small boys with whom he associates to steal. His mother
brought him to court this day and made the same complaint and both
request that he be committed to the S.T.A. From the statements of both
parents and after talking to the boy the court is satisfied that he is a
truant and delinquent and is stealing.

Often these young lawbreakers are schooled in crime by older boys or men
or even members of their families. This was evident in the case of the
eight-year-old-boy charged with housebreaking and larceny:

> Policeman B. found a raincoat and two pairs of shoes in the home of this
boy and arrested him. The boy admits that he and his uncle C.B. went to
the home of F. about 12 o'clock at night and the uncle took a watch and
chain and the boy a raincoat and the shoes home with him. The boy says
that they broke in the house. The boy's uncle got away and he does not
know where he is.

Sometimes boys as young as eleven or twelve are apprehended as members
of criminal gangs engaging regularly in housebreaking and thefts. The
extreme youth of the boys caught in such delinquencies is indicative of
the general lack of parental control among some elements of the Negro
population. In the complaint of the aunt against her wayward
twelve-year-old nephew we get a hint of the broken homes from which so
many of these delinquents come:

> This boy was brought into court by his aunt; she states that the boy's
mother is dead, that his father does not provide for the boy, that she
has reared him since he was one year old, that he will not work nor go
to school and associates with bad company and she can no longer control
him and wants the court to take the custody of him. She promises to
clothe him.

In fact, only 67 of the 176 delinquent Negro boys brought into court in
1929 came from families in which both parents
[363]{.pagenum}
were living together. In 37 other cases, although both parents were
living, they were separated, chiefly because of the desertion of the
father. Fifty-nine boys came from homes where either the mother or the
father was dead; and 13 had both parents dead. The home situation was
even worse in the case of the 68 delinquent girls; only 15 of them came
from normal families.

The charge of incorrigibility against 50 of these girls involved five
specific offenses: sex delinquency, truancy, ungovernability, running
away, and continued association with vicious companions.^[Huff, *op. cit.,* p. 56.] In 27 cases
there was sex delinquency ranging from initial sex experiences to
promiscuous relations and prostitution. Truancy, which was often
associated with sex delinquency, was found in 23 cases. Although
ungovernability was found as the sole offense in 7 cases, in 9 other
cases it was associated with sex delinquency, truancy, and running away.
Fourteen of the 15 girls who were charged with running away were most
frequently guilty of sex offenses, while the 5 girls charged with
association with vicious companions were generally guilty of the other
four offenses. A view of the type of family background from which some
of these girls come is given us in the following excerpt from the story
given by a girl charged with incorrigibility:

> I never want nor expect to return home again, never. I guess I haven't a
home anyway. I asked my adopted father to never come out here to see me.
He wouldn't get me any clothes then because I said I didn't want to see
him. He said if I didn't want to see him I sure couldn't have any of his
money or anything his money bought. When I left home to come here I told
that woman he lived with that the last thing I intended to do was to
poison both of them. I might change my mind though.

> My own mother and father are dead. I liked my adopted father [364]{.pagenum}
all right while my adopted mother was living. They were like real
parents to me. When my adopted mother got sick and stayed for a while
papa began running around with this woman that he is living with. One of
my chums put me on to it. This woman lived next door to her and she used
to see him going there. As soon as mama dies he took this woman in. It
wasn\'t more than a week after mama died. I told him that he ought to be
ashamed, and I said so much to him that he slapped me. He never had hit
me before, and think, hit me about that hoar, I never would eat at the
same table with them. After she came there to live I would leave for
school at 6 o\'clock in the morning, and I wouldn\'t come home until
late at night. I hated to go home. I promised to poison both of them and
they believed me. They tried to get Miss R. to put me in the C. D. Home
a long time before she sent me. Miss R. said she didn't blame me for not
wanting to stay around them. They would throw up to me about my real
mother, that she had had four children and never been married. I never
heard anything about this till this woman came.^[Quoted in *ibid*., p. 61.]

In some cases the delinquent behavior of these girls has not only been
taken over from their parents or other adults but represents their
response to what is held up to them as their expected role in life. A
woman who called the probation officer for aid in managing her
thirteen-year-old niece described the latter as follows:

> But I know Mary. I ought to when I have had her every since she was five
months old. I know I understand her. She is exactly like her mama. Her
mama is my baby sister, but the truth is the truth. She had Mary when
she was only 15 by an old nigger that didn\'t have a dime to his name.
He run off and she never heard of him again after he got her in trouble.
I kept her in my house until Mary was born, and treated her good and
helped her with the baby. Then when Mary was five months old this gal
ups and runs off with another nigger and I ain\'t laid eyes on her from
that day to this. Mary has never seen her mama to remember. So this gal
has just done like her mama. I understand alright.


[365]{.pagenum}
This girl's aunt was reputed to have once been a prostitute and was known
to be engaged at the time of the complaint in bootlegging. Her neighbors
described her as "just another whore" and claimed that she had forced her niece to "hustle" in order to get money for food and clothing.^[*Ibid.,* p. 74.]

Occasionally, delinquency on the part of these girls is the result of
the gradual breaking-down of standards that have been built up in the
rural environment. This is shown in the following document, which was
furnished by a seventeen-year-old girl.^[*Ibid.,* p. 77-79.] Moreover, this document is
of particular interest because it shows that, although the girl's
immediate family was broken by desertion on the part of the father, in
the rural community the children were integrated into the larger family
group. However, when the girl came to live in the urban environment, the
absence of a normal family life became the means by which she was led
into sex delinquency.

> From the time that I can remember anything my mother and we children
were living with our grandfather who had a farm out at&nbsp;---&ZeroWidthSpace;---
Tennessee. I was happy and so were my brothers
and sisters until grandpa would begin fussing. I remember how he used to
fuss long before I remember what he would be saying. I would know that
something made him mad. Soon my mother married again to a man who had
pretty good money for a country farmer. Then mama moved away to a town
about seven miles from us. All of us cried and begged her to take us but
she wouldn\'t. She said grandpa and grandma had helped raise us up to
where we was then and that we was just the size where we could be of
help to them, and said that now we could help pay grandma and grandpa
for the expenses they had been at for us. She said our father had never
done anything for us. That was the first time I had heard her say
anything about our father to remember. I guess when grandpa would be
fussing he would be saying something about him, but I didn\'t know it. [366]{.pagenum}
Anyhow I  remembered how he looked and asked grandma about him but she won't say much. But
before I was much larger I tooked and asked ima about him and found out
that papa quit my mama about months before my youngest brother was born
and came here with another woman. This woman use to come to the house
when mama and papa was living together and tried to be so nice to mama.
Mama really didn't know that papa and this woman was going together.

> Grandma said when one of mama friends told her about it she got mad at
her. Not long after this papa pretended that his oldest brother was at
the point of death in the city, and that he had to go at once. He didn't
come back again until my baby brother had been born and was six years
old. He didn't know papa and was scared of him like he would be of any
other strange man. When my baby brother saw him he said "Oh there is
Jimmy Holloman." He really didn't know papa. Then papa got mad about
that. That night my brother had earache and was crying. Papa got mad
about this and said that he needed a whipping for keeping up all that
racket. Grandpa told him if he laid his hand on the child he would kill
him dead. Papa left the next day and didn't come no more until grandpa
had been dead a long time. Mama had married and we were all large
children. He came to visit his sister and brother who lived at home.
Folks use to say that I looked exactly like his sister, Aunt Molly. But
Grandma didn't like that because she said that Aunt Molly was nothing
but a slut. She was married but she had had ten children and wasn't but
two of them her husband's. The other eight had stray daddies. We didn't
know how to act toward him and none of us would call him papa. We would
just begin talking and wouldn't call him anything. He stayed a month. He
swore that he wasn't married but he got a lot of letters while he was
there. He went to fishing one day and me and my sister went into his
things and found some things that almost made both of us faint. We found
first two letters from two children of his that he had in&nbsp;---&ZeroWidthSpace;--- a little town not far from here.
They were thanking him for sending them some stockings and other
clothes. The oldest one of these children was a boy and we found out
after we come here that this boy was almost as old as my youngest
brother. The other was a girl. We couldn't speak for a while after we
read these letters. There was a letter from their mama too. She said in
that letter something I will never forget the longest day I
[367]{.pagenum}
live about people calling her a fool for still being crazy about him but
that as long as she was satisfied they could go to hell. My grandma and
grandpa had said so many times that papa was nothing but a nasty,
stinking, low down nigger, who was too lazy to work and take care of a
family. I don\'t know why we ought to have been surprised to find out
more of his dirt but we were. I dreaded for him to come back from
fishing and hoped that he would soon go home. There he was sending this
woman and those bastards things when he hadn\'t send us hardly \$20
worth the whole while that he had been away.

Later, the girl came to the city to live with her father and stepmother.
Her story continues:

> I hated so bad to live in the place in which they were living. It was an
apartment flat with three families living up stairs and three
downstairs. Brother said that he had heard that not a one of the couples
was married. He didn\'t believe that papa was married to this woman
either. They played cards all day Sunday. This made me sick because
grandma had never allowed us to go to dances let alone play cards. I had
to sleep in the same room with papa and his wife. Brother slept in a cot
in the kitchen. There wasn\'t but two rooms. Papa and this woman would
often wake us up in the night doing their business. I wouldn\'t let on
that they woke me up. The springs would squeak and this woman wouldn\'t
let that noise do but I could hear easy enough. This made me sick again
I never had heard such at grandma\'s house and I looked down on that
kind of stuff. My sister came and we just lived through it. Sister and I
dreaded for night to come. We hated papa more and more.

The two sisters and their brother continued to go to church as they had
done in the country. This caused their father to ridicule them about
their "country" habits. Tension between the father and the children
continued to become more acute until finally there was an open break in
which the children engaged in a fist fight with their father. As the
result, the girls were put out of the home and reported to the court as
being incorrigible. Instead of sending them to the detention home as the
father requested, the
[368]{.pagenum}
court put them on probation to their brother. When their brother
married, they were without a home. The girl who was charged with sex
delinquency because of her conduct described below, and sent to the
detention home, ends her story with the following comment:

> After I had seen so much out of my father, and my brother had changed so
I just seemed to slip. When I began living on the place I would have one
day off. I didn't have any place to go. My boy friend invited me to
spend my off-time over at his place. Everybody sows their wild oats at
some time or other in their lives. I don't believe that I am guilty of
any sin because I am going to marry this feller.

Let us turn our attention from this southern city to New York City,
where, as we have seen, Negro juvenile delinquency rates suddenly jumped
in 1928 to 342 per 10,000 boys as compared with 170 in 1927.^[See p. 359 above.] In 1930
there were for all the boroughs 839 Negro children, or 11.8 per cent of
the total of 7,090 children, brought before the Children's Court. When
delinquents from all agencies were considered, there were 1,065 Negro
children, or 10.3 per cent of the total of 10,374 children. However, the
proportion of Negro delinquents among the delinquents in both groups
varied in the different boroughs. The rate was highest in the Manhattan
borough, where Negro delinquents before the Children's Court comprised
26 per cent of the total; whereas, in the borough of Brooklyn, Negro
cases comprised only 5.4 per cent of all the delinquents before the
court.^[Robison, *op. cit.,* p. 61.]

For our purposes here, we shall consider Negro boys and girls arrested
because of delinquency and neglect in the Harlem area during the years
1930-34.^[This information was collected in 1935 from the records of the police precincts while the author was engaged in a study of Harlem for the Mayor's Commission on Conditions in Harlem (see Map V).] On the whole, the
[369]{.pagenum}
number of Negro boys and girls arrested for delinquency has declined
since 1930, although the figures for 1934 indicated that the number of
delinquents was mounting again. This was especially noticeable in the
case of the delinquent girls

[TABLE 19. Number of Delinquent and Neglected Negro Boys and Girls Arrested in the Harlem Area, 1930-34]{.caption}

|            | Under 10 |    6 |    6 |   11 |    6 |    7 |

The vast majority of the Negro delinquents were between
ten and sixteen years of age; only about 3 per cent of the boys, except
in 1930, being under ten years of age. However, if the children arrested
because of neglect are considered separately, we find that the vast
majority were under ten years of age.

When we analyze the offenses for which these boys and
[370]{.pagenum}
girls were arrested, we find that, as in Nashville, the chief offense of
the boys was larceny and burglary; whereas 50 per cent of the girls were
charged with incorrigibility. Thus, in 1934 about 30 per cent of the
delinquent boys were charged with larceny and 10 per cent with burglary.
Among the more serious offenses charged against the boys, assaults and
holdups ranked third and fourth, respectively; whereas sex offenses held
second place among the girls. Two boys were charged with homicide in
1931 and one with the same offense in 1932. Although there was no change
in the rank of these various offenses among either boys or girls during
the five years, the proportion of boys arrested for larceny and burglary
increased appreciably, while the proportion for assaults and holdups
declined slightly.^[A study of delinquent and neglected Negro children in New York City twelve years ago showed a different distribution of offenses for the
boys. According to that study, the most common charges against Negro
boys were disorderly conduct and desertion of home; whereas
approximately 85 per cent of the Negro girls were charged with
desertion of home and ungovernable and wayward conduct. The most
common charges against the whites were stealing and burglary. Thus,
our figures indicate that the charges against Negro boys are at
present similar to those against white boys (see Joint Committee on
Negro Child Study, *A Study of Delinquent and Neglected Children
before the New York City Children's Court in 1925* \[New York,
1927\], P- 6).] The majority of the less serious crimes were
indicative of the lack of recreational facilities and programs for the
children of the Harlem community. For example, in 1934 eleven of the
boys were charged with hitching on trolleys and twenty-seven with
stealing rides on the subways. On the other hand, the comparatively few
boys charged with selling on the streets or shining shoes most likely
reflected the general poverty of the families in the area.

The relation of juvenile delinquency to the organization
[371]{.pagenum}
of the Harlem Negro community is not so apparent as in Chicago, where,
as we shall see, it is definitely related to the economic and cultural
organization of the Negro community.^[See the author's *The Negro Family in Chicago,* chap, ix, for a full
discussion of the relation of delinquency rates to the economic and
cultural organization of the Negro community.] In Chicago the percentage of
Negro delinquent cases among the cases brought before the juvenile court
has steadily increased since 1900. In that year 4.7 per cent of all
cases of boys before the court were Negro boys. The percentage of Negro
boys increased for each five-year period until it reached 21.7 in
1930.^[*Ibid.,* p. 206. During this same period the percentage of Negro
girls in the total cases increased from 11 to 20.9.] In Table 20 we have the number of delinquent and dependent
boys and girls brought into the juvenile court each year during the
decade 1920- 29. Naturally, these figures do not include all cases of
delinquency; in fact, they do not include all the cases of arrests for
delinquency. For example, in 1927 there were 1,503 boys arrested for
juvenile delinquency, although only 342 cases were taken into the
court."^[*Ibid.,* p. 205, n. 1.]

The marked increase in the proportion of Negro cases has coincided with
the increase in the Negro population during and since the war period.
However, what is more important is that this increase has followed the
settlement of the Negro migrant in areas characterized by a high
delinquency rate.^[Shaw, who has shown in a number of well-known studies the relation
between delinquency and community disorganization, makes the
following statement: "It is interesting to note that the main high
rate areas of the city --- those near the Loop, around the Stock Yards
and the South Chicago steel mills --- have been characterized by high
rates over a long period. Our data are based on records that go back
thirty years, and the early and late juvenile court series show
conclusively that many of the areas have been
characterized by high rates throughout the entire period. It
should be remembered that relatively high rates have persisted in
certain areas notwithstanding the fact that the composition (racial)
of population has changed markedly" (Clifford Shaw *et. al., Delinquency Areas* \[Chicago, 1929\], p. 203).]

The Negro, like other groups marked off from the general population
because of color and low economic and cultural status, has found a
dwelling-place in the deteriorated area just outside the Loop.^[Cf. Sophonisba P. Breckinridge and Edith Abbott, *The Delinquent Child and the Home* (New York, 1912), p. 153.] In
the zone nearest the center of the city, the juvenile delinquency rate,
based upon arrests, was over 40 per cent.^[See Map IV, p. 303.] From a physical standpoint
this area showed extreme deterioration and gave evidence of the
expansion of the central business district. On the one hand, there were
dilapidated houses carrying signs of rooms for rent at fifteen and
twenty cents a bed, junk shops, markets with stale meat, and crowded
Negro quarters with filthy bedding half-visible through sooty and broken
window
[373]{.pagenum}
panes. On the other hand, new motorcar salesrooms furnished signs of the
future role which the regenerated area would play in the organization of
the city. In keeping with the general character of the area, all
organized community life had disappeared, and the inhabitants were, on
the whole, remnants of broken families and foot-loose men and women. In
1921 the men in the county jail who claimed residence in this area
comprised over 9 per cent of the adult males living in the area.

Delinquency in Seven Zones of the South Side Negro Community, Chicago,

Although the delinquency rates in the next three zones were lower than
in the first zone, they were still comparatively high. About three out
of ten boys from ten to seventeen years of age were arrested for
juvenile delinquency in these zones. The significant drop in the
delinquency rate appeared in the fifth zone, where only 15 per cent of
the boys of juvenile-court age were arrested for delinquency. In the
sixth zone the delinquency rate continued to decline sharply, and in the
seventh zone only 1.4 per cent of the boys were charged with delinquent
behavior (see Table 21).

The decline in delinquency coincided with the decline in dependency,
family desertion, and illegitimacy in the seven zones indicating the
expansion of the Negro population. The
[374]{.pagenum}
rates were high in those areas that were characterized by physical decay
and the lack of organized community life. In these areas the customary
forms of social control, as represented by the family and the simple
folk culture of the migrants from southern communities, tended to break
down or to disappear altogether. Consequently, some of the fairly
well-organized families lost control of their children who took over
from boys or gangs patterns of delinquent behavior which were
characteristic of these areas. The children from the numerous broken
families, and whose mothers had to carry the entire burden of supporting
their families, easily drifted into delinquency.^[See Table 6, p. 307, above.] In the third zone,
where prostitution and other types of criminal behavior flourished, not
only were the children subjected to the criminal influences in the
neighborhood, but they were also influenced by the criminal behavior of
their parents. The decline in the delinquency rate in the areas toward
the periphery of the community coincided with the increasing
stabilization of family life and the disappearance of various forms of
social disorganization.

What we have observed in regard to juvenile delinquency in the Negro
community in Chicago is characteristic of other cities, in the South as
well as the North. Though the process of selection which is apparent in
the economic and cultural organization of Negro communities is less
pronounced and not so well defined in some cities, the incidence of
juvenile delinquency is closely tied up with the organization of the
community. Juvenile delinquency flourishes in those areas where the
Negro, because of his poverty and cultural backwardness, is forced to
find a dwelling-place. In the slum areas of Negro communities, because
of the numerous
[375]{.pagenum}
broken homes and the employment of the mother, the children lack
parental control which is sometimes able to offset the influence of the
vicious environment. Negro families with higher aspirations who are able
to achieve some economic security are constantly escaping from the
deteriorated slum areas. They move as far as they are able into the
areas where the more stable families and substantial elements in the
Negro population live and maintain orderly community life. This
selective process is the outcome of the rigorous competition which Negro
families must face in the modern urban environment, and their success or
failure depends largely upon their cultural as well as economic
resources.
