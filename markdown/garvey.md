<span class="pagenum">346</span>Garvey, himself, could not have planned a
more strategic climax to his career in
America than his imprisonment in Atlanta. The
technical legal reason for his incarceration is
obscured by the halo that shines about the head of
the martyr. There is a sort of justice in this; for
if the government were to punish all those who use
the mails to defraud, it would round up those energetic
business men who flood the mails with promises
to give eternal youth and beauty to aging fat
matrons, to make Carusos and Galli Curcis of members
of church choirs, and to make master minds
of morons. Garvey's promises were modest in comparison. 
And, indeed, what does one ship, more
or less, matter in an imaginary fleet of merchantmen?


There are aspects of the Garvey Movement that
can not be treated in this cavalier fashion. It is
those aspects we propose to set forth here. The
writer recalls that when he was a child one could
still hear Negroes express the hope that some Moses
would appear among them and lead them to a promised 
land of freedom and equality. He has lived
to see such hopes displaced by more prosaic and less
fanciful efforts towards social betterment. When
Booker Washington first appeared on the scene he
was hailed as a Moses. This was chiefly an echo
of the white man's appraisal and soon died down
when the Negro heard a message of patient industry,
unsweetened by any prospect of a glorious
future. What has distinguished the Garvey Movement 
is its appeal to the masses. While Negroes
have found a degree of self-magnification 
in fraternal orders and the church, these organizations
have not given the support to their ego-consciousness 
that whites find in the Kiwanis and especially
the Klan. Garvey re-introduced the idea of a
Moses, who was incarnate in himself, and with his
masterly technic for dealing with crowds, he welded
Negroes into a mass movement.

Before considering Garvey and his work, something
should be said of the people he had to work
with. The social status of the Negro in America
should make them fertile soil for a mass movement
to spring up in. They are repressed and shut out
from all serious participation in American life. Not
only does the Negro intellectual feel this repression,
but the average Negro, like all mediocre people
whose personalities must be supported by empty fictions, 
must find something to give meaning to his
life and worth to his personality. One has simply
to note how the superficial matter of color raises
the most insignificant white man in the South to
a place of paramount importance, in order to appreciate
how much support a fiction gives to one's
personality. Yet American Negroes have been
relatively free from mass movements. This fact
should not be regarded as a further testimony to
the Negro's reputation for a policy of expediency
in his present situation. There have been other
factors to take the place of mass movements.

Many American Negroes have belittled the Garvey 
Movement on the ground that he is a West
Indian and has attracted only the support of West
Indians. But this very fact made it possible for him
to contribute a new phase to the life of the American
Negro. The West Indian Negroes have been
ruled by a small white minority. In Jamaica, the
Negro majority has often revolted and some recognition 
has been given to the mulattoes. This was
responsible for Garvey's attempt, when he first came
to this country, to incite the blacks against those of
mixed blood. He soon found that there was no
such easily discernible social cleavage recognized by
the whites in this country. Yet his attempt to draw
such a line has not failed to leave its effect. The
fact that the West Indian has not been dominated
by a white majority is probably responsible for a
more secular view of life. The Garvey Movement
would find the same response among the Negroes
of the South as among the West Indians were it
not for the dominating position of the preacher,
whose peculiar position is symtomatic of an otherworldly 
outlook among the masses. Even in the
face of this situation foreign Negroes have successfully
converted hard-shelled Baptists to the 
Movement in spite of the opposition of their ministers.
This secular influence in the life of the Negro
attains its true significance when viewed in relation
to the part that preparation for death plays in the
life of the black masses.

The Garvey Movement afforded an asylum, as
all mass movements, for those who were dissatisfied
with life for many reasons, which could in
this case be attributed to their status as Negroes.
Although most of his followers were ignorant, we
find among them intellectuals who had not found
the places in the world that their education entitled
them to. Instead of blaming themselves,—and they
were not always individually responsible—they took
refuge in the belief that in an autonomous black
Africa they would find their proper place. The
black rabble that could not see its own poverty,
ignorance, and weakness vented its hatred upon
obscure "traitors" and "enemies," who generally
turned out to be Negro intellectuals who had
achieved some distinction in American life. There
is good reason to believe that Garvey constantly
directed the animosity of his followers against the
intellectuals because of his own lack of formal
education.

We have noted how the Garvey Movement
turned the Negro's attention to this world. This
was accomplished not only by promising the Negro
a paradise in the future in Africa; but through the
invention of social distinctions and honors, 
the Ne<span class="pagenum">347</span>gro
was made somebody in his present environment.
The humblest follower was one of the “Fellowmen
of the Negro Race,” while the more distinguished 
supporters were “Knights" and "Sirs."
The women were organized into the Black Cross
Nurses and the men into the Great African Army.
“A uniformed member of a Negro lodge paled in
significance beside a soldier of the Army of Africa.
A Negro might be a porter during the day, taking
his orders from white men, but he was an officer in
the Black Army when it assembled at night in
Liberty Hall. Many a Negro went about his work
singing in his heart that he was a member of the
great army marching to 'heights of achievements'."^[“Garvey: A Mass Leader”, <em>The Nation</em>, Vol. CXXIII, No.
3189 by the writer.]
Yet these extravagant claims were based upon the
deep but unexpressed conviction in the minds of
most Negroes that the white man has set certain
limits to their rise in this country.

In his half acknowledged antagonism towards
Negro preachers and the soporific religion they
served the masses, Garvey did not ignore its powerful 
influence. In fact he endeavored to fuse the
religious experience of the Negro with his own
program. The symbolism associated with Christmas
was made the sign of the birth of a Negro nation
among the nations of the earth; while Easter became
the symbol of a resurrected race. Nor did
he overlook the opportunity to make his position
appear similar to that of Jesus. According to him,
his own people, especially the recognized Negro
leaders, had incited the American authorities against
him just as the Jews had incited the Roman authorities
against Jesus. In this connection the idea of
gaining a lost paradise appears as it does in most
mass movements. The “Redemption of Africa"
became the battle cry. To his followers he
trumpeted: “No one knows when the hour of
Africa's redemption cometh. It is in the wind. It
is coming one day like a storm. It will be here.
When that day comes, all Africa will stand together."^[Ibid]

The messianic element in this movement is not
altogether lacking, although it does not stand out
prominently. When Garvey entered the prison in
Atlanta, besides commending his wife to the care of
his followers, he spoke of the possibility of his death
as only a messiah would speak. Under the caption,
"If I Die In Atlanta,” he bade his followers:

> Look for me in the whirlwind or the storm, look
for me all around you, for, with God's grace, I
shall come and bring with me the countless millions
of black slaves who have died in America and the
West Indies and the millions in Africa to aid you
in the fight for liberty, freedom and life.^[<em>The Negro World,</em> February 14, 1925.]


By this promise Garvey raised himself above mortals 
and made himself the Redeemer of the Black
World.

Many people are at a loss to understand how
Garvey was able to attract supporters to a scheme
which was manifestly infeasible and has been discredited by continued exposés of corruption and
bickering within the organization. But such tests
of reasonableness can not be applied to schemes that
attract crowds. Crowds, it has been said, never
learn by experience. The reason is clear, for the
crowd satisfies its vanity and longings in the beliefs
it cherishes. Not only because of their longing for
something to give meaning to their lives, but because
of the scepticism about them, Negroes do not find
the satisfaction that their fathers found in the promise 
of heavenly abode to compensate for the woes
of this world. They therefore offer a fine field
for charlatans and fakirs of every description. This
Movement has attracted many such men who give
the black crowds the escape they are seeking. The
work carried on by the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People, which has
been the subject of so many attacks by Garvey, has
never attracted the crowd because it does not give
the crowd an opportunity to show off in colors,
parades, and self-glorification. The Association appeals 
to intelligent persons who are trying to attain
tangible goals through cooperation. The same
could be said of the Urban League. Dean Kelly
Miller, it is said, once made the shrewd observation
that the Negro pays for what he wants and begs
for what he needs. This applies here as elsewhere.
Those who support this Movement pay for it 
because it gives them what they want—the identification 
with something that makes them feel like somebody 
among white people who have said they were
nobody.

Before concluding this brief interpretive sketch,
we must add a few observations. Doubtless the
World War with its shibboleths and stirrings of
subject minorities offered a volume of suggestion
that facilitated the Garvey Movement. Another
factor that helped the Movement was the urbanization of the Negro that took place about the time. It is in the cities that mass movements are initiated.
When the Negro lived in a rural environment he
was not subject to mass suggestion except at the
camp meeting and revival.

One of the most picturesque phases of the Movement 
has been the glorification of blackness which
has been made an attribute of the celestial hierarchy.
To most observers this last fact has been simply a
source of merriment. But Garvey showed a knowledge
 of social psychology when he invoked a black
god to guide the destiny of the Negro. The God
of Israel served the same purpose. Those whites
who said they would rather go to hell than to a
heaven presided over by a black god, show what relation 
the average man's god must bear to him. The
intellectual can laugh, if he will; but let him not
forget the pragmatic value of such a symbol among
the type of people Garvey was dealing with.

The question is often asked, “Is Garvey sincere?” The same question might be asked of the
McGee brothers of the Kentucky Revival and of
evangelists in general. Although Garvey's appeal
has been more permanent, his methods have 
been<span class="pagenum">348</span>
in many respects those of the evangelist. Just because 
evangelists as a rule are well fed and free
from material wants, it would be uncritical to put
them all down as common swindlers. Likewise,
with the evidence we have, we can not classify
Garvey as such. He has failed to deal realistically
with life as most so-called cranks, but he has initiated 
a mass movement among Negroes because it
appealed to something that is in every crowd-minded 
man.
