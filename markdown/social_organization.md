[372]{.pagenum}Most discussions of the question of Negroes in the labor movement have
centered around the issue of racial discrimination. While discrimination
undoubtedly has been a powerful factor in restraining Negroes from
joining trade unions, the fact should not be overlooked that the
defensive reaction of the community against such prejudice has been to
confirm the point of view of those who are suspicious of or even fear
white workers. This has led to the development of a strong sentiment
among Negroes (both workers and others) against union organizations.
This sentiment, unless combated, will act as a significant barrier in
keeping Negroes out of trade unions even after union doors have been
completely opened to them. It is important, therefore, to examine the
social structure of the Negro community to see who its leaders are, what
class divisions exist within the community and what organizations
encourage attitudes either favorable or unfavorable toward union
organization.

## The Class Structure of the Negro Community

Negroes in America are by no means a homogeneous group. Although they
were introduced into this country as slaves and for a short time were an
undifferentiated mass of laborers, it was not long before differences in
occupation, training, and education began to appear. Perhaps the first
differentiation to arise was that between the field hands and the house
servants during the slavery period. Later, numbers of slaves were taught
mechanical and skilled trades and became far superior in many ways to
the rest of the slave population. With emancipation, differences in
education, training, and occupation permitted the development of well
defined social strata within [373]{.pagenum}the group. The migration to
cities, which has been a continuous process since the Civil War, gave
the more educated and trained upper strata (largely mulatto), with their
superior education and cultural advantages and their greater familiarity
with the city life, an opportunity hitherto denied to exploit this
education and training. They furnished the professional and business
services which the black migrants to the city needed. Reuter says:


> ... there was a need for teachers and preachers, for physicians and
lawyers, for business men and entertainers, and for all the host of
other parasitic and semi-parasitic classes that go to make up a modern
community. With the rise of a middle-class, the race was able to support
a professional and leisure class; previously the educated Negro was an
idler and a parasite. The isolation of the race forced Negroes to depend
upon their own educated men and so made a place for such men.^[1. Edward Byron Reuter, *The Mulatto in the United, States*, p. 359.]


In Chicago, for example, there had always been a few Negro professional
and business men. But in the words of one doctor the migration "helped
colored lawyers, doctors, and every colored person in Chicago." He
continued:


> They have been our best patrons. ... I do not believe that this office
building would have been here today if it had not been for those Negroes
who came from the South. In less than thirty-eight years we have
increased from five to two hundred and fifty doctors. We are living in
better homes, and have more teachers in the schools; and nearly every
colored church has benefited.^[2. E. Franklin Frazier, *The Negro Family in Chicago*, pp. 108-9.]


Thus the wave of plantation Negro migrants to the cities definitely
established a small elite at the top of the Negro social group.

The development of this Negro upper class is reflected in the census
returns for the decades since 1890. Listed in the professional service
group for 1890 were to be found 33,994 Negroes. This number increased to
47,219 in 1900; 68,350 in 1910; 81,771 in 1920; and 135,926 in 1930.
This last figure [374]{.pagenum}shows an increase of nearly 50 per cent for that census
period alone. In the thirty years from 1900 to 1930 the number of
physicians increased from 1,734 to 3,805, the number of dentists from
212 to 1,773, lawyers from 728 to 1,175, teachers from 21,267 to 54,439,
and clergymen from 15,528 to 25,034.

Although the number of professionals has increased tremendously within
the last forty years this group still represents a small per cent of the
total Negro population. The professional service group (eliminating for
the moment the middle class business men) increased from 1 per cent of
the total Negro population in 1890 to 2.5 per cent in 1930. At this
latter date there was one clergyman for every 475 Negro inhabitants, one
dentist for every 6,707 inhabitants, one lawyer or judge for every 9,536
inhabitants, one physician or surgeon for every 3,125 inhabitants and
one school teacher for every 218 inhabitants. There were also some
business men who belonged to this class. In addition to those members of
the upper class who were professionals and business men, administering
to the needs of the Negro community, the Negro upper class also included
a large number of persons who in one way or another were dependent upon
white persons and (more or less directly) upon upper class white persons
for their status. This group included administrators and other employees
of certain social and philanthropic agencies, professionals employed by
businesses and industries owned by whites, politicians (who were a part
of the city or local political machine), and some social workers.^[It should be emphasized that the term "upper class," when applied to Negroes, refers to the position of certain Negroes *within* the Negro community. The income, standard of living, cultural attributes, etc., of the Negro upper class is comparable probably to the "middle" section of the white middle class, rather than to the white upper class.]

There also has appeared within the pyramid of Negro society a middle
class composed of small shop keepers, independent farmers, skilled and
semi-skilled artisans, and civil service employees. This group has begun
to fill the distance which existed between the masses of the race at the
bottom and the small class of educated Negroes at the apex of the
pyramid. The professionals and the highly successful business group are,
of course, [375]{.pagenum}at the top of the pyramid and constitute the
upper class within "this world within a world."

This numerically small group of upper class Negroes have created for
themselves a social world which is, in a sense, apart from both Negro
and white groups. Although they consider themselves culturally,
educationally, and economically superior to the great mass of Negroes,
as indeed they are, they have overcome their aversion to the lowly
black, lower class Negro and have assumed a position of leadership
within the group.

> They are the men who teach the black man \[lower class Negroes\] in the
schools and in the Negro colleges, who preach to him from the pulpits,
who manage his books and business enterprises, who rise to prominence in
all the social, political, and economic affairs of the race. They, too,
are the men who rob and defraud him in the lodges, who grow wealthy,
through appealing to the Negro's desire to be like the white man, with
nostrums to blanch the skin and straighten the hair, who gain wealth and
distinction among the race by fostering, and catering to, the Negro's
morbid interest in and superstitious fear of death and love of vulgar
funeral display. But whether they guide and help the black man or fatten
on his gullibility, they are in every respect the prominent men of the
race and the leaders in the race's social affairs.^[4. Reuter, *op. cit*., p. 361.]

These persons, who, before they were able to occupy this position "on
top of the Negro community," were restless and arrogantly resentful
toward the social organization which did not seem to offer a place for
them, now have become respectable, comfortable, and have in fact
"settled down." There is, of course, some agitation for extended civil
rights but these protests are seldom carried to the point where the
fight would endanger the comforts of their position or cast reflection
on their respectability.

The philosophy of the upper class Negro as expressed by one of its most
able exponents, Dr. DuBois, encourages the development of the able
educated class as a means of salvation for the masses of the Negroes.
Thus DuBois' plea for the "Talented Tenth" was made on the basis of
racial advancement.[376]{.pagenum}"The Negro race," he said, "like all races, is going to be saved by its
exceptional men. The problem of education, then, among Negroes must
first of all deal with the 'Talented Tenth'; it is the problem of
developing the Best of this race that may guide the Mass away from the
contamination and death of the Worst, in their own and other races. Can
the masses of the Negro people be in any possible way more quickly
raised than by the effort and example of this aristocracy of talent and
character?"^[*The Negro Problem*, a series of articles by representative American
Negroes of today.] Whether this argument be true or false, it has been used
as a rationalization for the development of the talented upper class
rather than, and often to the detriment of, the black masses. But the
fact is that the elite in the Negro world has no more love for its
masses than the white elite has for its masses. The distance is about as
great in the former case as in the latter. However, the color line which
divides all Negroes from all whites has led to expressions by upper
class Negroes of sympathy and pathos for the lower class which, on a
verbal level, exceeds that of the whites. The educated upper class Negro
does not, now that he has found a comfortable place, care to champion
doctrines which purport to help the black worker by changing the social
system, for he recognizes that it is this social system that has given
him a position of advantage within his group. In addition to the fact
that he is complacent and respectable, or perhaps because he is
complacent and respectable, the upper class Negro is economically
conservative. His primary interest tends to be in that which protects
the differential between himself and the Negro masses, rather than in an
effort to improve the conditions of the majority of his group in a
manner which almost necessarily endangers his own position.

The Negro masses have accepted the leadership of this handful of upper
class persons. Since black workers have been isolated from the influence
of the white working class, the talented, educated members of their
group appeared as their natural leaders. Race consciousness has built up
a semblance of solidarity between the classes which has benefited the
Negro [377]{.pagenum}elite by providing its members with a tenable social
position and has benefited the blacks by giving them leaders who have
symbolized to them their possibilities as persons if conditions but
allowed.

The Negro upper class depends on this racial solidarity to maintain and
enable it to exploit the market for professional and business services
which racial prejudice has tended to create. This situation has been
referred to as "the advantage of the disadvantaged." As early as 1850
the idea of developing an economic structure within the Negro group
paralleling that of the white community was championed and has continued
to the present. The appeal has been made for the development of a "black
economy" which would furnish work for young Negroes and advance the race
generally. No Negro employer was ever engaged in business for the sordid
purpose of making money. On the contrary all were motivated solely by
the desire to build race institutions and to create opportunities for
youths. Toward this end Negro consumers were supposed to patronize Negro
business and professional men even though the goods and services might
be inferior to those of their white competitors and more expensive as
well. On the other hand, Negro employees of colored business men, in the
name of race loyalty, were supposed to be willing to make sacrifices in
the form of low wages, long hours, and poor working conditions.
Recently, when employees of the *Amsterdam News* (a Negro newspaper)
began to form a labor union, William Pickens, of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, stated that colored
workers should not join labor unions if they are employed in Negro
business enterprises, since their employers are struggling to build up
race business. This argument is curiously similar to the infant industry
argument for protective tariffs.

In their relationship with upper class whites the Negro elite have been
tractable and, as leaders of their race, have proved valuable to the
white elite in controlling the mass of Negroes. Thinking and feeling
toward the lower class Negroes in much the same way as does the upper
class white man (because they are in the same sort of relation to these
Negroes as are the [378]{.pagenum}whites), the "good" colored people and
the "good" white people have seldom failed to get together upon
questions of policy. This does not mean that the Negro upper class has
never fought for the rights of the Negro masses but rather they have
tended to fight their own battles in the name of the masses and have
continually compromised on issues which, if actually resolved, might
endanger their class position. The Negro upper class has always occupied
a paradoxical position in that the very roots of its existence are a
ghetto system and at the same time it is ideologically committed to
agitation for civil rights and the abolition of all forms of segregation
and prejudice. Its hope for expansion, and in fact its very existence,
is dependent upon a continuation and strengthening of racial solidarity.
Abstract principles of equality which were important in gaining and
holding the leadership of the race have tended to become less attractive
to this class. The espousal of such ideals, now that the depression has
weakened their position, constitutes an additional threat to their
already precarious existence.

Toward the labor movement the Negro upper class has been generally
antagonistic. This antagonism, in some measure, may be traced
historically to the economic rivalry which existed between the slaves
and the poor whites of the South in pre-Civil War times. The treatment
of Negroes by the white working class and by union organizations since
emancipation has tended to aggravate this antagonism. Negro leaders saw
that unions attempted to keep Negro workers out of industry and that
employers often opened industrial opportunities to them. Since Negro
leaders tended to think in terms of their own class position their
reasoning seems to have been that, if the Negro is to be exploited, it
is better that he be exploited by the white employer who offers some
rewards in the form of more employment and promotions than by white
workers. Many members of this class have maintained their positions by
the tolerance of the white employing group and have inevitably been
influenced to some extent (consciously or unconsciously) by their
financial dependence on well-to-do white persons. Negro politicians and
political appointees who constituted an important section of the [379]{.pagenum}elite
were for the most part dominated by the city political machine, which in
turn was always subject to considerable control by business and
industrial interests. In many industrial centers, Negro doctors and
lawyers, to say nothing of the clergy, often had profitable connections
with the large industrial concerns.

But perhaps the most important factor in the antagonism of the Negro
elite toward labor unions has been their "rise by individual merit"
philosophy. Believing that education and training would break down race
barriers on the one hand, and (paradoxically enough) make possible a
Negro economic structure on the other, they have constantly refused to
think in terms of labor or labor organizations. From this group have
arisen a number of schools of thought; the common characteristic of all
of these philosophies is an intense consciousness of race. Carried to
their logical conclusion these programs would develop a black economy
within the white economy of this country and would encourage the
creation of a large Negro upper class. Since it is necessarily based on
race solidarity, such a program is directly opposed to any which has as
its objective the development of coöperation between black and white
workers. These social programs held little for the black worker except
the substitution of Negro employers for white employers, but many Negro
workers have been influenced by their philosophy and are not aware of
the social role of class differences within their group. They have
allowed a handful of highly romantic, race-conscious, upper class
Negroes to lead them into accepting the myth of a "black economy." These
workers have been encouraged to turn their backs on the white laboring
man and his unions.

It is extremely improbable, with a very few exceptions, that the present
Negro leadership will encourage the Negro worker to line up in a fight
against the capitalistic interests of the country. Negro leaders as a
class will probably have little sympathy with any organization which
might engage in long, bitter, and bloody economic warfare. They will
hardly undergo the disadvantages of loss of prestige and the curtailment
of income necessarily involved in such a struggle. With the ever-present
[380]{.pagenum}opportunity to earn large sums by strike-breaking, these
upper class, capitalistically indoctrinated Negroes will prefer the
opportunistic procedure of compromise and its immediate monetary
compensation. They may play the same role, since they occupy the same
position as the white professional men, the business interests and the
small shopkeepers of industrial centers from whose numbers have arisen
the bloody vigilante committees and the "back to work" movements.

Schuyler recently commented as follows concerning the attitude of the
Negro upper class toward union organization:

> Their desertion of the struggling Negro workers in this crisis
constitutes one of the most shameful chapters in our recent history. The
new position Negro labor has won in the past year has been gained in
spite of the old leadership. It has been won with new leadership;
militant young men and women from the ranks of labor and grizzled black
veterans of the pick and shovel and the blast furnace.^[George S. Schuyler, "Reflections on Negro Leadership," *Crisis*, LXIV (November, 1937), 328.]

He concludes:

> Nowhere was the bulk of Negro leaders actively aiding the Negro workers
upon whom they depended for a livelihood. Nowhere were the "educated"
classes co-operating with the unions to aid the work of organization,
save in a few notable instances, and there by only one or two
individuals. Nowhere were Negro preachers opening their churches for
labor meetings although they were glad to give any itinerant bush priest
a "break." Here and there a preacher, lawyer, a politician or social
worker was found whose aid to the workers cannot be too highly
commended. But a great many more denounced the new unions as "radical,"
were belligerent in siding with the employers and in some instances
openly recruited strikebreakers to take the jobs of the black unionists.
The sentiments they expressed were invariably a rehash of the editorials
in the local kept press. ...

> But the most disheartening observation in connection with this labor
revolution was the indifference, hostility and open opposition of so
many "educated" Negroes holding positions of trust and leadership in
their respective communities. Their reactions to the labor drive
[381]{.pagenum}seemed to range from sheer ignorance of the issues involved
to active co-operation with the efforts of employers to halt the
workers' bid for power and protection.^[7. *Ibid*.]

In the recent organizational drive of the C.I.O., it was found that in
almost every locality the Negro professional and business groups opposed
the participation of Negro workers. The *Pittsburgh Courier* said:

> Black Detroit is in uproar and confusion as the zero hour looms for the
showdown fight between Ford Motor Company and the United Automobile
Workers of America. Sides are being taken violently. Most of the
preachers and professional men are against the U.A.W. and openly in
favor of the Ford Motor Company. Dependent upon the masses for their
livelihood, they fear that if the Ford Negroes espouse the union cause
they will ultimately lose their jobs which would be a major disaster for
Detroit.^[8. September 2, 1937.]

In St. Louis it was reported that only two preachers out of hundreds had
taken any favorable interest in the unions. "... one reason advanced for
the indifference or hostility of most of the Negro preachers to
organized labor is that they are constantly begging small sums from
various business concerns, and so feel indebted to them."^[9. *Ibid*., September 9, 1937.] In Chester, Pennsylvania, "Rev. Barbour severely scored the 'better' Negroes for
their reaction-ism and slave psychology. 'They do not lift a finger,' he
said, 'to protect the masses of their people. They have the utmost
contempt for the masses.' "^[10. *Ibid*., August 12, 1937.] The situation was no different in
Indianapolis, Indiana, "The attitude of the rest of the leading Negroes
allegedly runs from indifference to hostility."

There have been, however, some few individuals and organizations that
have given encouragement to labor. A handful of prominent individuals
such as Robert Vann of Pittsburgh, Earl Dickerson of Chicago, J. F.
Marney of Cleveland, Harry Pace of Chicago, and State Representative
Marshall Shepard of Philadelphia have supported the organization of
Negro workers verbally. The National Medical Association is reported to
have [382]{.pagenum} endorsed the C.I.O. as tending to raise the standard
and position of Negro labor.

None of the old conservative leaders in the Negro community, verbal
assertions to the contrary notwithstanding, possess the capability or
the willingness to consummate an effective program for organizing Negro
labor. The prejudice toward Negroes demonstrated by the American
Federation of Labor has enabled many persons presumably interested in
Negro unionism to express their supposed sympathy for labor by attacking
the American Federation of Labor and at the same time to do nothing
themselves which would actually further the organization of Negro
workers. While it has not been possible to extend the charge of racial
prejudice against the Committee for Industrial Organization, Negro
leadership has discredited the movement by characterizing it as
"radical" and "communistic."

With this summary description of the broad outline of class differences
within the community, it will now be possible to discuss the use of
community leaders and institutions by the industrial interests to
discourage Negro membership in unions.

In recent years, Negroes have for the most part entered the large
"trustified" and non-union industries. Often they have been hired for
the purpose of weakening unions already formed or unions in the process
of being formed by white workers. Many of the large companies which
began to employ Negroes at this time previously had had difficulties
with foreign-born white workers. It was important for them to keep
Negroes from joining unions, both because they were becoming numerically
important in some of the industries and because they were considered the
force which was to split labor into uncoöperating racial groups. With
this objective in mind, these companies have developed organizations, as
well as utilized existing organizations within the Negro community, to
control the lives of their Negro workers and to mold public opinion in
the Negro community against unionism. This was not such a difficult task
in most cases, for, as we have seen, the leadership in the Negro
community is for the most part in the hands of a conservative,
[383]{.pagenum}capitalistically-minded educated class, anxious to
coöperate with the white upper class; that the predominant myth in the
community is one of the "black economy"; and that the historic
competition between the white and Negro working class has created
intense chauvinism among white workers and race consciousness among
Negroes which has usually made coöperation between the two groups
impossible.


## Negro Welfare Workers and Social Clubs Fostered by Private Industry


One of the most important techniques employed by steel companies has
been that of maintaining Negro welfare and social workers to control
opinion in the community and report the outside activities of the black
workers.^[The present discussion relates particularly to the concentration of
these practices among Negro workers. In the steel industry as a whole,
in 1930, Negroes constituted 8.5 per cent of the total employees, .1 per
cent of the professional, technical and highly skilled group, and 18.5
per cent of the social workers. This discussion does not concern
professional social workers in bona fide private or public social
agencies.] Such people usually have been chosen because of their
influence and importance in the colored community.

Negro social workers were first introduced into the steel industry in
1918 at the insistence of the Pittsburgh Urban League. At that time,
eighteen Negro welfare workers were placed in the eleven plants which
hired the majority of the Negro laborers in the industry.^[12. Spero and Harris, *The Black Worker*, p. 258.] The
appointment of a Negro to such a position gave him an estimable status
in his community. The fact that he was received in the front office, had
a desk in the employment superintendent's department, and talked
familiarly with the bosses engendered among Negroes the idea of a
democratic spirit on the part of the management. To add substance to the
illusion, managers occasionally gave Negroes other white-collar
jobs.^[A. Philip Randolph, in writing about the advanced positions of some
Negroes in the Pullman Company, asserted: "Anything which does not
benefit the rank and file of porters is no benefit at all. Such is the
case with the porters who have been given big jobs in the Pullman
offices at big salaries. Those jobs only benefit the job holders and the
company, not the Pullman porters. The jobs are only given to impress the
porters with the idea that the company is doing something for them; that
it has an interest in them. *They are jokers*. For they only help to
chloroform the porters and keep them from organizing. Don't look to the
Negroes holding jobs in the company for a remedy. They cannot speak out.
They dare not speak out. If they do they will lose their jobs." \["The
Case of the Pullman Porter," *The Messenger*, VII, (July, 1925), 255.\]]


[384]{.pagenum}The purpose of the Negro social worker was explained by one of the
personnel directors of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation as follows:

> The welfare worker has given us insight into what we term the
peculiarities of their race, that perhaps otherwise could never have
been understood. We seek information regarding employees that will be to
their benefit both on and off the job. We, therefore, want the worker to
feel free to come to us whenever he so desires.^[W. J. Knapp, "An Experiment with Negro Labor," *Opportunity*, I (February, 1923), 19.]

Knapp pointed out further that one of the duties of the welfare worker
was to keep the company informed of the behavior of its employees while
they are off duty.

> One of the many successful efforts has been the investigating of our men
off duty, through the welfare worker. By this means we are able to catch
up the loafer, thus ridding the community of undesirables. ... Through
our welfare worker, we were able to trace out disorderly houses and
close them up promptly.^[15. *Ibid*.]

Such pronouncements indicate the extent to which the Negro community is
under the control and constant surveillance of the steel companies.
Concerning the practices of one social worker, a Negro steel worker in
Duquesne, Pennsylvania, remarked:

> B&#11834; is supposed to be the Negro welfare director, but he
goes around the colored and reports to the company whether the men are
for the company, how they live and everything else. He is no good and
anybody will tell you that. He is the company's "stool pigeon." No one
respects him no more than they do the other "stool pigeons." \[Interview
(Duquesne, Pa.) July 17, 1934.\]


> [385]{.pagenum}If we had a better colored welfare man for the company who would not be
a "stool pigeon" and a messenger for the company. ... But the Negro
welfare worker has his own class who associates together and works
against the working colored man. He is making it bad for himself and his
race. He snoops around and goes into the homes and looks into the morals
and tries to keep the colored down, cut their relief and everything. We
can't get nowhere because of that. \[Interview (Duquesne, Pa.) July 18,
1934.\]

Negro social workers have other special assignments besides that of
espionage. They are sent out as election workers when their companies
are interested in a political campaign or issue. An instance of such
activity is reported by a Negro steel worker.

> The Negro welfare worker goes through the city and tells Negroes to vote
on this or that man with specimen ballots showing that the Republican or
Democratic Party backed this man and that the company is one hundred per
cent for him. They tell you to vote this way or lose your job. Plenty of
colored are afraid to come out to register and vote like they want to.
\[Interview (Duquesne, Pa.) July 17, 1934.\]

In the recent drive to institute company unions, Negro social workers
were sometimes instructed to regiment the unemployed workers to vote for
the plan.

> In June, 1933, B&#11834;, the Negro welfare man, told me to go
into the mill, that they had an open gate on that date, and vote for a
representative. That was for the nomination, and the following Friday we
went back for election. That was the last date I was inside the mill
gate. If I had it to do over I would not vote again. \[Interview
(Duquesne, Pa.) July 17, 1934.\]

An important function of some Negro welfare workers at the present time
is to indoctrinate Negroes against unionism. One of the welfare workers
described how this was done.

> We had no open campaign against Negroes joining the union, but we did
good work informally. Take the men who have been working for the company
for the past thirty years, both those who are on pension or who are
working for pensions. We got them to talk around with the other workers.
Perhaps the best argument is when [386]{.pagenum}these old workers tell
about the strike of 1892 when the union was first broken up and Negroes
were allowed in the industry for the first time. \[Interview (Homestead,
Pa.) July 6, 1934.\]

This welfare worker was a preacher in a small church and hence was able
to reach directly a number of workers.

> I am a preacher too and I have a church of about five hundred members in
Rankin. I did not speak out for a long time. Then finally I did talk. I
told them that the company respected the freedom of the pulpit and that
no one had asked me to speak. Then I talked against an outside union and
told them what my attitude was. After that only one man of my
congregation joined the outside union and he was one of those fellows
whom you can't tell anything to. \[Interview (Homestead, Pa.) July 6,
1934.\]

He also tried to win the support of other ministers.

> The Negro preachers have not done as much as they could in the
situation. You know some people would be willing to sell the "cloth."
Some of these preachers have been very lax and would sell their race for
a mess of pottage. There was one Negro preacher out in Braddock. One of
the officials asked me to talk to him and said, "I've talked to him but
he will not listen." I went to this preacher and explained to him what
he was doing. He said, "They \[the union\] promised to make me a
donation." I asked him if he would sell out his race for a donation.
There was a meeting scheduled, but after I had talked to him he gave up
the idea and cancelled the meeting. Other preachers in Clairton are all
right. They think clearly on this matter and advise their people along
right lines. \[Interview (Homestead, Pa.) July 6, 1934.\]

When asked what technique he considered most effective in fighting
unionism, he answered:

> I think that the best method of reaching Negroes is through personal
interviews. Just to mix with and talk to the men in small groups or
individually. In such small groups as Bible classes lots of effective
work can be done. Women are also very effective. You can reach these
women through women's clubs and churches. They will influence the men.
Lots of good work has been done over back fences. \[Interview
(Homestead, Pa.) July 6, 1934.\]


[387]{.pagenum}Closely related to the activities of the welfare workers are those of
social clubs which exist in most important steel plants and often are
organized by social workers.

> In addition to the shop representative plan we have a group of old
employees who have formed a social club. They call it the Diamond C Club
because that is our trademark. It is strictly a social affair. Recently
they had a picnic and I went there myself and played ball. There are
only about 150 members because of the size of the dining room. We have
been holding it down and admit only the older workers. \[Interview with
an officer of the National Malleable Steel Company (Cleveland, O.).\]

This club was started by a Negro representative of the Employees'
Representation Plan.

> ... I started the club myself as soon as I was elected a representative.
At the first meeting I invited sixty men and forty of them showed up,
also the manager and assistant manager, together with about ninety men.
It was such a success that it was a shock to them. The next meeting was
at the Phillis Wheatley house. We had as guests the manager, the
employment manager, the paymaster and the company treasurer. At the
picnic there were several foremen and superintendents. After the picnic
the fellows got together and wanted to have a baseball game. I believe
our whole salvation lies in our club which is social and educational. I
believe an outside union would do us more harm than good. It would be
made up of Bolsheviks and foreigners and as a result the colored man
would be on the outside. The company is a very fair type. It is an
organization that is dependable. \[Interview (Cleveland, O.) August 10,
1934.\]

Some of the workers had other notions about the club. One of the members
remarked:

> They have about one hundred men in there, and they meet in the company
dining room. The company also gives them \$25.00 a month. With the
\$25.00 the company gives them and the amount they collect from the men
we have about \$100.00 a month in the treasury. But there is a rule,
that we have to spend it and they see to it that we do not save
anything. I suggested that we buy coal by the carloads and sell it to
the members cheaper, but the president of the club, who is by the way
secretary of the representative organ[388]{.pagenum}ization, was against this.
\[Interview (Cleveland, O.) August 5, 1934.\]

Not all of the workers believe these organizations serve purely social
ends or that companies are interested only in the social life of the
employees. "Some fellows think," stated the president of the club in
Cleveland, "this is a salve to heal a sore." \[Interview (Cleveland,
O.), August 10, 1934.\] In Clairton, Pennsylvania, a worker remarked,
"They tried to fix that mushball field to satisfy the working class
people. They give us discounts on railroad fare to the World's Fair.
Things like this are to pacify us." \[Interview (Clairton, Pa.), June
11, 1934.\]

Many large companies have exploited the southern background of their
Negro workers. In assuming an apparent interest in the social lives of
the workers, they have seemed to adopt the parental attitude toward the
entire community which is characteristic of southern Negro-white
relations. Such gestures as sending turkeys at Christmas, getting people
out of jail, or taking up collections from the men in the plant to help
a sick worker indicate a deliberate effort to reinforce this
(ostensible) pattern. The general foreman of one of the Carnegie plants
told this story:

> A colored fellow got arrested a while back and he wanted to get a letter
of character from me. So I wrote him one as I knew the judge for a long
time and the judge let him out. Then he came back and told the other
fellows, "Mr.&#11834; sure can help you if you get in jail; he is
the Court." They appreciate those things. Of course we have a few
malcontents, some that we can't sell our idea to. But you have them
every place. \[Interview (Clairton, Pa.) June 13, 1934.\]

Among some southern Negroes, accustomed only to the plantation pattern
of social relationships, these gestures of good will and interest obtain
the desired response. A Negro welfare worker in the Pittsburgh district
recalled what he termed a typical incident illustrating the appreciation
of colored workers for the kind treatment they received from the
company.


> [389]{.pagenum}Last winter a Negro worker came in for relief. I talked to him about the
union and he said that he was against it. I asked him why and he said,
"Last winter when the snow was on the ground and there was no money in
the house the company fed me and gave me milk for my babies. I would be
an ingrate to bite the hand that is feeding me." \[Interview (Homestead,
Pa.) July 6, 1934.\]

"There was a time," stated a Negro worker in Cleveland, "when they made
plenty of money and took care of their men. They are loyal to their
colored help. They have helped them in hospitals and made loans."
\[Interview (Cleveland, O.).\]


## The Negro Church

Financial contribution to various Negro organizations has proven
advantageous to industrial concerns in enlisting the allegiance of
Negroes and in making them more susceptible to manipulation by the
company. In support of his opinion that the company really had the
interests of the Negro at heart, a member of an Employees'
Representative Plan related:

> At the Phillis Wheatley House, Miss H&#11834; made an appeal for
money for the Association. A few days later the superintendent showed me
a letter where he sent ten dollars to the Phillis Wheatley in
consideration of the work they were doing for the Negro girls.
\[Interview (Cleveland, O.) August 10, 1934.\]

The Negro church has received more attention from plant officials than
any other institution in the community. The sympathy of colored
preachers for industrial management is of long standing. Their
antagonism toward labor unions may be traced to ignorance of union aims
and principles but other members of the profession are frankly
opportunistic. For some time they have looked upon the companies as
sources of revenue and in terms of self interest alone have usually
refused to do anything which might jeopardize this source of income. The
*Negro in Chicago* reported:

> The union organizer in the steel strike, W. Z. Foster, stated that at
one of the conferences held by the Commission that, after an address
[390]{.pagenum}to the Negro steel workers at a church in Pittsburgh, the
Negro preacher had said to him: "It nearly broke up the congregation,
but we decided you were going to speak here in this church." The
organizer continued: "Then I got the underneath of all this thing and
found that this church had lost a donation of \$2,500 from the Steel
Corporation for allowing me to speak. They had tried to block my speech
to these colored workers in Pittsburgh. Whenever it's a question of a
donation to a poor, struggling church like that, we know what usually
happens."^[16. *The Negro in Chicago*, p. 427.]

A preacher in Gary analyzed in realistic terms the relationship existing
between many Negro churches and the United States Steel Corporation.

> Because the company controls this city, there are few of us who are not
afraid to go against the wishes of Mr.&#11834;, who runs this town.
To work here you must work for some part of the mill directly or
indirectly. ... There is no way the colored have to say anything against
this. ... When I came here I attempted to establish a Presbyterian
Church. We asked the company for \$5,000 and they gave us \$500. What
has happened is that the churches have become subsidiaries of the steel
corporation and the ministers dare not get up and say anything against
the company. Since companies have gained control of the city churches,
they have ceased to give money for the past four years. \[Interview
(Gary, Ind.) August 23, 1934.\]

Another Gary preacher revealed the steel company's dictatorial control
over the program of the churches. This minister realized fully his role
in the situation and was somewhat apologetic for having to follow
company orders.

> Yes, the steel companies have been willing to help us. They have aided
most of the churches in a material way. The establishment of this agency
\[a social center\] was brought about through the joint enterprise of
the company and the church. The company was not satisfied with the
program of the churches. So out of the proposal of the company they
bought this property and said they would share dollars in the erection
of this building. They have co-operated in the activities. ... I don't
want you to think that I am a tool for the company, but there are
circumstances that. ... \[Interview (Gary, Ind.) August 27, 1934.\]
:::

::: noindent
[391]{.pagenum}One of the workers said of this clergyman:

> Reverend&#11834; runs the Settlement House. He is a "stool-pigeon"
for the company and is close to Mr.&#11834;. He has fed many people
during the depression and the company has helped him. Around 1927 and
1928 the colored had a club that met in the Settlement House and of
course Reverend&#11834; was always present and would keep the
company posted. He is still getting assistance from the company. He is
the only colored man that can go into Mr.&#11834; \[a steel
company official\] office at any time. \[Interview (Gary, Ind.) August
28, 1934.\]

Another Gary preacher stated:

> In 1919 the company tried to get a Negro sub-division, and they wanted
me to put my church there, and because I refused, they have never helped
me at all.

During the campaign to organize the steel industry, both the A.A. and
later the C.I.O. met with the resistance of the Negro church as has been
mentioned before. However, the C.I.O. has perhaps not suffered from the
antagonism of the Negro clergy to quite as great an extent as has the
A.A. One C.I.O. union reported:

> All we have met from the Negro preacher ... is discouragement. They
don't seem to care anything about the low wages and bad working
conditions their people suffer, nor the feudal condition which exists in
the plants here. \[Interview (Gary, Ind.) August 29, 1934.\]

While this statement is quite generally descriptive of the attitude of
the Negro ministry throughout the country, there have been noteworthy
exceptions. In nearly all of the important steel producing centers there
was usually one minister who espoused the union cause. At the conference
of Negro steel workers which was held in Pittsburgh in February of 1937
the following ministers attended: Doctor King of Pittsburgh, pastor of
the Ebenezer Baptist Church; Rev. L. R. Mitchell, president of the
Ministers' Alliance of Chicago and Indiana Harbor; Doctor J. C. Austin,
pastor of the Pilgrim Baptist Church of Chicago 3 and Bishop W. A.
Walls, A.M.E. Zion Church, Chicago.
[392]{.pagenum}Bishop Walls, in addressing the conference, stated in regard to the
attitude of Negro ministers toward union organization:

> You must not spend your time criticizing Negro preachers. You educated
them; they must stand by you. All you have to do is to organize and tell
them so, and if they don't want your organization in the church you men
go down the aisle on Sunday and say to that preacher: "If you eat my
bread the time has come when my minister must stand by my toils and my
struggle to put bread and meat in my children's mouths, and if you
don't do that we don't want your gospel because it is not
Christ's."^[Speech given before the Convention of Negro Steel Workers.]

Since the financial resources of the Negro people were so limited, many
of the social service organizations of the Negro community were
necessarily supported by white philanthropists. These institutions have
on occasion been used to defeat union organization and quell the unrest
among Negro workers by directing dissatisfaction into the safe channels
afforded by company dominated organizations. *The Negro in Chicago*
noted in this connection:

Many labor leaders and union members believe that welfare clubs, company
Y.M.C.A.'s, glee clubs, and athletic clubs are encouraged and
supported by employers as a substitute for a form of organization which
they cannot control. The subsidizing of social movements and churches is
regarded as one of the means employed by large employers to insure this
reserve of strike breakers.^[18. *The Negro in Chicago*, p. 427.]

The Wabash Avenue \[Negro\] branch of the Y.M.C.A. in Chicago
coöperated with a number of industrial firms in developing the so-called
Efficiency Clubs.

The work of the Efficiency Clubs of Armour & Company, the International
Harvester Company, Morris & Company, Swift & Company, Wilson & Company,
Pullman Car Shops, Corn Products Refining Company, has brought about a
sense of responsibility on the part of the industrial worker and
sympathetic understanding and good will on the part of company
officials.^[George R. Arthur, "The Young Men's Christian Association Movement
Among Negroes," *Opportunity*, I (March, 1923), 16-18.]

[393]{.pagenum}These organizations, like the company unions, were allowed more or less
to pass out of existence during the first years of the depression but,
with the coming of the union movement in 1933, they were rather hastily
revived. That these clubs are dominated by the companies is
substantiated by the remarks of one of the club officials, who was
questioned by the investigator concerning the nature and function of
these organizations.

We have decided that you had better get your information from the
companies. We have always found the company to be fair to the men and we
feel that all information regarding these clubs should come from the
companies themselves. \[Interview (Chicago, Ill.) January 11, 1934.\]


## The Negro Press

The Negro press has not been active in encouraging Negroes to join
unions nor has it dealt at any great length with the problems of the
Negro and trade unionism. The pages of most Negro papers, like those of
most daily papers, are filled with news about crime, sex, politics,
sports, and social functions. Such labor news as does appear usually
consists of articles exposing discrimination against Negroes by labor
organizations. For example, in August of 1934, the *Birmingham World*
reported in a large caption "Race Loses Out in 'Frisco Ship Strike
Settlement.'" The article read in part:

> The hopes of several hundred Negro strikebreakers to retain their jobs
or secure other type of employment on the docks, "went the way of all
flesh" yesterday, when the officials of the International
Longshoremen's Association demanded that all strikebreakers be
discharged, especially Negroes, or they would refuse to return to their
jobs. \[Interview (Chicago, Ill.) August 7, 1934.\]

Another caption, in a Norfolk paper ran "New York Saleslady Made Victim
of Racial Prejudice by Labor Union."^[20. *Journal and Guide*, June 23, 1935.] Any discriminatory act on the
part of the American Federation of Labor is considered to have great
news value. Under the caption, "Urban League Condemns Jim Crow in Labor
Ranks," the [394]{.pagenum}*Journal and Guide* reported the entire
National Conference of the Urban League.

When a prominent business or civic leader addresses a Negro group, the
account of his talk is often printed in detail regardless of his
attitude toward unionism. When one of Ford's social workers spoke to a
Negro group in Detroit the *Afro-American* under the caption, "Ford
Manager Calls Union's Enemy---Unions Worst Enemy of the Negro---Ford,"
reported:

> If the automobile factories in Detroit ever fall under the control of
the American Federation of Labor and its affiliates, it will mean the
closing of the door to the Negro laborers.

This was the statement made by Donald J. Marshall of the St. Antoine Y.M.C.A. Sunday. Mr. Marshall is connected with the employment office of
the Ford Motor Company, the largest employer of Negro labor in the
world. It is believed he spoke with the backing of Mr. Ford. All Negro
labor must come through the hands of Mr. Marshall.

The speaker declared that an effort is now being made to organize the
automobile workers in Detroit. He stated that a large number of Negro
workers had already aligned themselves with this union movement,
thinking that this is the way to employment.

If Detroit had been a union city, there would not be 4,600 Negroes
employed at the Ford Motor Company, Mr. Marshall stated. The unions
would control the shops, and he would not have been in a position to
have hired the Negro laborer.^[21. January 13, 1934.]

These articles present but one side of the union question to the Negro
community. Many of the papers, like the reform organizations, are
strongly race conscious and envisage the entire situation from the point
of view of equal rights. To them it is more "newsworthy" to play up
discriminations exercised by certain unions than to show that some
unions are anxious to have Negroes as members. During the entire
campaign to organize steel workers under the N.R.A., there was little or
no labor news in important Negro papers. Just before the threatened
steel strike in 1934, there was not a single news item concerning the
situation in any of the four leading Negro papers although
[395]{.pagenum}many thousands of Negroes would have been affected by the
strike.

Editorial comments of these papers reflect a similar lack of information
and voice the old fears concerning white workers. The *Pittsburgh
Courier* stated editorially:

> Judging by the past (which is all we have to judge by) the Black worker
will strike as readily, stay out as long and picket as regularly as
anybody else, but all of the time he will want to know that he is not
being made the "goat" to be cast aside; discriminated against by the
white union when the battle is won. White labor has been in the habit of
doing that.^[22. June 9, 1934.]

The *Afro-American* of Baltimore, Maryland, noted:

> Unless the A.F. of L. is able to make its locals throughout the country
open their doors to colored members in all crafts, it may be necessary
for colored labor to organize and join in a country-wide fight on the
unions.^[23. April 19, 1934.]

What would seem to be a more progressive attitude appears in an
editorial in another leading Negro newspaper:

> Too large a part of the time, attention and talents of Negro
organizations have in the past been spent trying to re-mould the views
of white capitalists and too little to remoulding the views of white
proletarians, which is far more important. That some unions practice
segregation and discrimination is no more reason for completely washing
our hands of them than it is for not dealing with the Y.M.C.A., the
Y.W.C.A., the Catholic and Protestant churches, bankers,
industrialists and merchants.^[24. *Pittsburgh Courier*, April 14, 1934.]

Although most of the lack of attention paid to labor and the bias
against labor organizations arises honestly as a reaction of an
intensely race conscious group toward acts of discrimination,
nevertheless, there is evidence of outright corruption on the part of
some few of the Negro papers. When large industrial interests exert as
much control over the daily press of the country as they do, it is not
to be expected that the Negro press would entirely escape their
influence. An instance in Chicago [396]{.pagenum}which involved the
Pullman Porters' union and a Negro paper illustrates this aspect of the
situation.

After supporting the organization of the Pullman Porters in 1925, the
*Chicago Whip* suddenly began to attack the union. The attack was
directed ostensibly against the discriminative practices and
paradoxically plutocratic and communistic principles of the American
Federation of Labor with which the Pullman Porters were affiliated. In
fact, the argument ran, most labor unions were not free of "Kleagles and
Goblins of the Ku Klux Klan" and furthermore the Pullman Porters'
organization did not believe in God.^[25. October 15, 1925.] These arguments were answered
by A. Philip Randolph in the *Messenger*.

> You know and everybody else knows ... that you are not opposing the
Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters because you think it is connected
with the American Federation of Labor. That's merely a reason, not the
reason. ... Your real reason is the advertising you are getting from the
Pullman Company to oppose the movement.

> Without the slightest compunctions or scruples, you are willing to
betray and sell out your race for a miserable mess of pottage.

> Have you so soon forgotten that at the banquet of the porters, at the
Wage Conference in 1923, you advocated organization, that you urged them
in the *Whip* to organize?^["A Reply to Joe D. 'Blibb,' 'Idiot-or' of the Chicago 'Flip,'
mis-named the 'Whip.'" The *Messenger*, VII (December, 1925), 378.]

Later, one of the men connected with the *Whip* told the story of the
change in policy of the paper in more detail:

> Yes, after 1925 there was a change in the policy of the *Whit*.

> It came about in this way. To save the stockholders who had invested in
the *Whit* we made a deal with Insull. In this deal Insull took over
about \$22,000 worth of stock. Then this necessitated the changing of
our policy. Later when Insull's lawyer became the lawyer for the
Pullman Company we had to change our policy toward the Pullman Porters'
union. Before, we had been favoring it and we just had to pick out
something and fight it. We just had to make a reason for being against
it. There was an exposé in the *Messenger*, but it was only half the
truth. They never did know the whole story. \[Interview (Chicago, Ill.)
February 28, 1933.\]

[397]{.pagenum}While the Negro press in general ignored, or was unaware of the
organizational campaign in 1934, the C.I.O. was news which no other
papers could afford to overlook. Sometime after the C.I.O. had become a
national issue of some consequence, Negro papers finally began to note
its attitude toward colored workers. In the *Chicago Defender* there
appeared over a period of a few months fifteen or twenty articles which
reported C.I.O. news. A prominent place was given to notices of mass
meetings and one large picture was published which showed Van A. Bittner
of the Chicago area of the S.W.O.C., surrounded by a corps of Negro
steel organizers.

Perhaps the paper which paid most attention to the movement was the
*Pittsburgh Courier*. Robert L. Vann, editor of the *Courier*, was very
sympathetic toward the C.I.O. He stated, at a meeting of Negro steel
workers in Pittsburgh:

> ... I tell you that this effort to organize Negroes in the steel
industry is going to be largely hampered in this district at least by
Negroes who will be paid by this very industry and I serve notice on you
now that I shall expose to the reading public the name and address and
the mother and father of any Negro I can find who does that.^[Speech given before the Convention of Negro Steel Workers,
Pittsburgh, Pa.]

The best reporting on labor news came from George S. Schuyler who, as
feature writer for the Pittsburgh Courier, toured the country in 1937 to
find out what Negroes were doing in the labor movement.^[The author found this series of articles very helpful and has made
considerable use of them and wishes to acknowledge the help which Mr.
Schuyler\'s writing has been to him.]

The above illustrates the extent of the mechanisms which have been
employed to control public opinion in the Negro community and the role
of some of the important institutions in consciously or unconsciously
assisting this end. We will now examine some of the national
organizations to see just what part they are likely to play in the
struggle between union or nonunion forces.


## National Negro Organizations

It is important in this discussion to take into consideration the
various national organizations maintained by Negroes, for these
organizations attempt to define for the community the objectives and
aims which should be worked for; and to analyze and interpret the world
of events and the position of the Negro within this larger setting. In
this discussion it will be possible to consider only the three most
important of these organizations---the National Urban League, the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and the
National Negro Congress. Both the Urban League and the N.A.A.C.P. are
reform groups, organized on a national scale and supported by a
relatively small section of the Negro population---the Negro upper
class. Since Negro workers have developed no strong organizations of
their own, the Urban League and the N.A.A.C.P. have been almost the only
Negro organizations, until recently, which have articulated any point of
view on labor problems. Thus they have been able to speak as if they
represented the entire Negro group. The National Negro Congress
represents a relatively recent attempt to organize the entire Negro
community in a broad "progressive united front" movement.


### The Urban League

In 1906, William H. Baldwin, Jr., president of the Long Island Railroad
and president of the General Education Board, formed an organization
called "The Committee for Improving the Industrial Conditions of Negroes
in New York City." In the same year Miss Frances Kellor formed "The
League for the Protection of Colored Women." The purpose of this latter
group was to assist colored girls and women in securing work and
lodgings in the city of New York. In 1910 Mrs. William H. Baldwin, Jr.,
called a meeting in New York City of all social agencies interested in
the Negro and formed an organization called "The Committee on Urban
Conditions among Negroes in the City of New York." In the interests of
economy, these groups were merged in 1911 to form the "National Urban
League." All of these organizations had arisen as attempts to
[399]{.pagenum}deal with the acute problems affecting the Negro population
in New York.^[29. Paul E. Baker, *Negro-White Adjustment*, p. 21.] These problems were largely a function of the migration
of large numbers of Negroes from the rural South to a metropolis (and
the adjustments which this change involved) and the segregation of
Negroes in New York into crowded, unhealthy residence districts in the
city.

Today, the Urban League has a national office in New York and forty-two
loosely connected branches which are practically autonomous. These
branches are located in principal cities throughout the North. The
national staff is comprised of 16 paid members and there are 184 paid
workers in the 42 branches, thirty-two of which are located in community
chest cities and are supported in part by local chest funds. The League
is controlled by a national board and by local boards in each branch.
There are 1,200 members on these boards; board members are usually
prominent business men and civic leaders in the various communities. The
national board exerts little control over the various local branches.
Lack of centralized control is indeed one of the weaknesses of the
organization.^[In a regional conference, the following memorandum was given to
local secretaries: "However, we have been handicapped several times in
our efforts because we have not been able to present a combined front
with our local organizations. The National cannot have the prestige when
its efforts arc weakened by the apathy and neglect of the local branch."
(From a mimeographed sheet entitled "A Regional Conference Memorandum
for Local Secretaries," September 3, 1933, p. 2.)]

Mrs. William H. Baldwin, Jr., who acted for some time as chairman of the
national board, has expressed her notion of the purposes of the League
as follows:

> When we, colored and white people, banded together in our League, seek
to better conditions among the Negroes of Harlem, or San Juan Hill, or
Brooklyn, we seek also to make a better New York City for everybody to
live in and to help in some measure towards a truer realization of the
ideals of sound community living in our great republic.^[31. Baker, *op. cit*., p. 22.]

The aspirations of the League were set forth more explicitly perhaps by
the national officers two decades ago.

> [400]{.pagenum}The objects of this organization are to bring about co-ordination and
co-operation among existing agencies and organizations for improving the
industrial, economic, social and spiritual conditions among Negroes and
to develop other agencies and organizations where necessary; to secure
and train Negro social workers; to make studies of the industrial,
economic, social and spiritual conditions among Negroes, and in general
to promote, encourage, assist and engage in any and all kinds of work
for improving the industrial, economic, social and spiritual conditions
among Negroes.^[32. "A Regional Conference Memorandum for Local Secretaries," p. I.]

The original purpose of the League, then, was primarily to engage in
social work. Its early activities were more or less confined to that
field and it was not until later that the League became interested in
the trade union movement.

The national office of the Urban League has, on several occasions,
declared itself favorable to organized labor and has suggested, with
some reservations, that Negro workers become union members. At the
annual conference of the Urban League, held in Detroit in 1919, it was
stated:

> We believe in the principles of collective bargaining, and in the theory
of co-operation between capital and labor in the settlement of
industrial disputes and the management of industry, but in view of the
present situation, we advise Negroes in seeking affiliation with any
organized labor group to observe caution. We advise them to take jobs as
strike breakers only where the union affected has excluded colored men
from membership. We believe they should keep out of jobs offered in a
struggle to deny labor a voice in the regulation of conditions under
which it works.

> But, we believe the Negroes should begin to think more and more in the
terms of labor group movement, so as ultimately to reap the benefits of
thinking in unison. To this end, we advise Negroes to organize with
white men whenever conditions are favorable. Where this is not possible,
they should band together to bargain with employers and with organized
labor alike.^[Extracts from "A Way Out," A Suggested Solution of the Race Problem
adopted at the Annual Conference of the National Urban League, Detroit,
Michigan, October 15-19, 1919.]

In 1918 the Urban League presented to Gompers, then president of the
American Federation of Labor, a resolution requesting [401]{.pagenum}the
Federation to take active steps to bring Negro workers into the fold of
trade unionism. In 1920 the League again made a similar proposal. In
1925 the Industrial Relations Department of the League was organized and
the director of the department approached the Executive Council of the
American Federation of Labor in an effort to encourage that body to
undertake actively the organization of Negro workers. The League

> ... offered to raise one-half of the salary of a competent Negro who
would work under \[William Green's\] direction in trying to smooth out
the relationship between the colored workers and the various component
national and international organizations, but \[Green\] informed
\[them\] that the "Executive Council does not at this time feel that the
American Federation of Labor can undertake to meet the expense which
would be involved in carrying out \[their\] proposition."^[T. Arnold Hill, "Open Letter to Mr. William Green, President,
American Federation of Labor," *Opportunity*, VIII (February, 1930), 57.]

In 1933, after the passage of the National Industrial Recovery Act, the
League issued a statement concerning the Negro in trade unions.

> It may be well to state that the Urban League believes in collective
bargaining; that its policy with regard to the organization of Negro
workers is based upon that principle rather than upon the recognition of
any particular group of organized labor and that it believes in the
organization of workers. ... The Urban League's main interest is to
establish the democracy of negotiation and compromise in industry as a
substitute for the autocratic control that has made the adjustment of
the workers difficult.^["Interpretative Statement to Secretaries," mimeographed supplement
to the National Urban League, A Regional Conference Memorandum for Local
Secretaries, September 28, 1933, p. 2.]

In regard to "left-wing" unions, the League was even more liberal.^["The question might arise---should one encourage membership in the
American Federation of Labor, in the left-wing unions of the Communist
Party, or in the Socialist labor unions? This is entirely a matter of
local consideration. In some instances, the left-wing unions remain the
only ones in which one may expect the development of this bargaining
power among Negro workers.... In the main, however, the most highly
developed form of labor organization expressing this policy of
collective bargaining is found in the regular American labor unions,
such as those affiliated with the American Federation of Labor."
*(Ibid*., p. 3.)]

[402]{.pagenum}However, the activities of the Urban League have thus far been confined
almost entirely to verbal statements of sympathy with the principles of
unionism. It has never actually approached rank and file Negro workers
in any attempt to form trade union organizations and has dealt only with
high officials in the trade union movement. Its activities with respect
to trade unionism, as described by the director of the Department of
Industrial Relations, have consisted of sending resolutions and making
various overtures of good will to the officials of the American
Federation of Labor. As proof of their willingness to coöperate with the
Federation, the Industrial Relations' director stated:

> We have supported the cause of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters,
we have contributed articles to the *Federationist* and you have
contributed an article to our magazine *Opportunity*. We have invited
you to speak before our National convention on more than one
occasion.^[Hill, "Open Letter to Mr. William Green, President, American
Federation of Labor," *Opportunity*, VIII (February, 1930), 57.]

That the League considers itself purely an advisory body, rather than an
active participant in trade unionism, is evident from the instructions
given to local secretaries in regard to the organization of labor
encouraged by the National Industrial Recovery Act.

> The League does not believe that Local Secretaries should become union
organizers. They may bring the men together for the purpose of
organization, they may encourage it in every way, but the organization
should be left to the union officials and to the men themselves.^["Interpretative Statement to Secretaries," p. 3.]

It has been easy for the national office to make liberal gestures and to
voice trade union principles. The branches, however, [403]{.pagenum}faced
with a conservative and often reactionary board of business men and
social workers, pressed by the necessity of soliciting money and
remaining on good terms with the administrators of the community funds,
and attempting to establish a "social work" attitude among business men
(the success of which program depended upon the good will of the
employing group) have found it necessary to compromise time after time
on matters of labor policy. It is not that local officers are
necessarily more reactionary than the national officers but rather that
they are faced with the day-to-day problem and conflicts which are
inevitable in an organization which is supported by capitalist
interests, even though its program may be dedicated to the welfare of
workers. No association which actively participated in a program to
organize labor would long receive the support either of a community
chest or of individual business men in any American community. The local
secretaries have sensed this situation and, since also most of them have
had little or no experience or training in the problems of labor
organization, they have tended to emphasize exclusively the social work
program of the Urban League.

But labor problems cannot always be ignored and in controversial
situations it has often been necessary for the League to assume a stand.
Although the Urban League has no real mass following, many Negro workers
have looked to it for leadership in times of industrial crisis. Also,
business interests which have supported the League have exerted numerous
claims upon the organization during periods of labor disturbance. The
Negro laborer, untrained in union tactics or principles, seldom makes
articulate demands for unions. With no pressure from the workers, the
secretaries often saw no reason to sacrifice their program and the
financial support of their branch to the idealistic principles of trade
unionism. "The character of the League differed from city to city, but
everywhere the outstanding characteristic of its policy was
opportunism."^[39. Spero and Harris, *The Black Worker*, p. 140.] The League, existing largely by virtue of the
financial support of the employing class and at the same time trying to
maintain [404]{.pagenum}its face with labor organizations, has on several
occasions made verbal statements in support of trade unions and then
sponsored counter-activities in critical situations.

An example of this is to be found in the behavior of the Chicago Urban
League during the controversy over the Negro Pullman Porters' movement.
The controversy arose in 1926 and was coincident with the League's
annual drive for funds. Eugene K. Jones, executive secretary of the
National League, publicly endorsed the porters' organization.
Immediately after his statement appeared in print, the Pullman Company
called the Chicago Urban League and asked whether "Mr. Jones was
speaking for the whole Urban League or merely expressing his personal
viewpoint." The Chicago officers explained that the National League had
no control over the various branches nor did it attempt to dictate their
policy. After this clarifying statement "the Pullman Company made its
contribution."^[40. *Ibid*., pp. 141-42.]

The branches of the League have often justified injudicious interference
in strikes on the grounds that they could not in any event have
succeeded. Thus one writer defends the strike-breaking activities of the
League (and Y.M.C.A.) in the stockyards strike in Chicago with the
following argument:

> The writer recently heard a colored stock yards union man bitterly
denouncing the Urban League and the Y.M.C.A. for what he thought was
their interference in the stock yards strike. His denunciation was
bitter and typically union as any the writer has ever heard, but the
writer knew that with 20,000 Negroes unemployed over a period of years
in a great city like Chicago, where at all times the struggle for
existence is keen, that the calling of the strike was pure folly, and
that no force, social or otherwise, could have saved the situation to
the union. If the statements of the stock yards officials may be
accepted, the strikebreakers were about equally divided between white
and colored men who preferred the danger of a strikebreakers' position
to the suffering incident to unemployment.^[ William L. Evans, "The Negro in Chicago Industries," *Opportunity*,
I (February, 1923), 15-16.]

[405]{.pagenum}The important aspect of this case is that Negroes were members of the
union and that it was a colored union worker who spoke against the
activities of the League.

The National Urban League took no active part in the attempt to organize
the steel industry during the N.R.A. period, in spite of the fact that
steel was probably the most important single industry in the country
employing Negroes and that Negroes were solicited to join the union on
terms of equality. No explanation was offered by the national office for
this lack of interest but it was again stated that the League did, and
always had, supported organized labor.

The National Urban League did not advise Negroes with respect to their
union procedure in connection with the attempt of the Amalgamated
Association of Iron, Steel and Tin Workers to enlarge its membership.

> The policy of the organization has been for a long while, and still is,
that of encouraging Negroes to affiliate themselves with organized
labor. In 1919 we declared this position in a public statement. Since
then at intervals we have made known the same policy. At our Regional
Conferences held last year and the year before we issued pronouncements
to this same effect. \[Interview, August 10, 1934.\]

Various local branches took different attitudes toward the attempt to
organize steel. The Pittsburgh branch of the League was busy making a
survey of employment among Negroes on federal funds and did not know the
extent of union organization in that important steel district. Until the
time of the strike threat, the League had done nothing to determine the
degree to which Negroes participated in the union movement or to aid in
their organization.

The Cleveland League played a reactionary role and was even instrumental
in breaking up an incipient union. Most of the Negro workers in that
city were afraid to join the Amalgamated Association. One of the colored
workers decided that it would be better to organize the Negroes in his
plant separately than to have no organization at all but he was opposed
by an officer of the Urban League.

> [406]{.pagenum}I made an attempt to organize Negro workers, but as usual there was a
lot of talk about it. We had a meeting on Sunday and on Monday the
general foreman called me in. He asked me what we were organizing for,
and I told him I was not trying to start a union but a social club where
we could get together and meet each other. What I really wanted to do
was to find out what the other men were talking and thinking about. I
thought that if we could organize a club and make a strong enough
organization we could just have a union over night and no one would be
the wiser.

> C&#11834;, of the Urban League, was altogether against my
organization. He didn't want things done in that way. But he did favor
the club which was organized within the plant. That isn't what I
wanted. Because the way it is now, the superintendent of the plant is an
honorary president and some officers of the company sit in at all of our
meetings and hear everything that we have to say. I don't know why
C&#11834; wanted it that way. When I asked him he said that he
thought we should take up our problems with the management. \[Interview
(Cleveland, O.) August 10, 1934.\]

The executive secretary of the Negro Welfare Association (a branch of
the Urban League) had been called by the general manager of one of the
steel companies and told that "some dissatisfaction" had been stirred up
among the Negro workers. After the industrial secretary visited the
plant, Mr. C&#11834; (the executive secretary) called the workers
into his office to find "their difficulties and to reason with them and
notify the company of the conditions which the Association found that
needed correction." \[Interview with staff members of the Negro Welfare
Association, Cleveland.\] By such interference the Negro Welfare
Association broke up this feeble attempt to organize.

"Our local organizations," stated T. Arnold Hill, director of the
Department of Industrial Relations for the national office, "have
frequently had occasion to enlist the support of Negro workers on behalf
of union activities."^[From a letter to the author, September 13, 1934.] This statement certainly did not apply to the
activities of the Chicago Urban League during the recent attempt to
organize the steel industry. So antagonistic was that organization that
its officers not only [407]{.pagenum}refused to aid the campaign but
actively worked against it. Their industrial secretary wrote:

> The Chicago Urban League is not in favor of this strike. But at the same
time it has not found it necessary to be active in advising workers not
to strike, inasmuch as almost all of the Negro workers contacted in the
Gary and Chicago area had absolutely no intention of striking.^[From a letter, June 26, 1934.]

He did not favor the strike because he felt that:

> Strikers have absolutely no chance of winning the strike, and it will
mean tremendous loss of pay and possibly loss of jobs in the event that
strike breakers are brought in. Secondly, since this is a strike
primarily for union recognition and the union refuses to recognize
Negroes (i.e., generally speaking) I fail to see why the Negro should
jeopardize his chance of a job by striking for the recognition of the A.
F. of L. The company attitude has of course been to employ Negroes.^[*Ibid*. See [Chapter X] for a description of
the Amalgamated\'s attempt to attract Negro membership.]

The following statement epitomizes the opportunistic philosophy of the
Chicago Urban League:

> Since the company has in the past advanced Negroes from the status of
common laborers to semi-skilled and skilled positions, the probability
is that they will continue to do so. In talking with the company
officials, I have been assured that they will continue this policy and
that the loyalty on the part of the Negro workers will be rewarded.

> Therefore ... if the Negro supports the A. F. of L., he will probably
wind up by finding himself definitely excluded from the best jobs, and
if the A. F. of L. organizes the industry, introducing a closed shop,
the companies will no longer be able to continue their policy to employ
Negroes to offset collective bargaining, and the incentive for the
employment of Negroes will be lessened.

> On the other hand, if the Negro exercises his position as a minority
group and plays the management against the remaining workers, he will
get more thereby.

> I would go further and even suggest Negroes go in as strikebreakers,
provided they were retained when the strike was over.^[45. *Ibid*.]

[408]{.pagenum}
The secretary outlined the program of the League, which doubtless meant
the Negro Workers' Councils of the National Urban League, as follows:

> Of course, I don't think conditions in steel are ideal, but I simply
feel that the Negro should go along with the company this time.

> I am organizing Councils of Steel Workers in order to advise and help
them advance as much as possible in the industry.^[ *Ibid*, The Workers' Councils of the Urban League are referred to in [Chapter XX].]

The industrial secretary of the branch wrote to the Secretary of Labor
as follows:

> We see then that although the open shop policy of the steel corporation
may not on the whole be considered beneficial to labor, nevertheless, it
has offered occupational opportunities to Negroes. And, in fact, the
standard of living of the Negroes in the steel industry is much higher
than the average for the Negro workers as a whole. It seems, then, that
although conditions at present may be far from ideal, nevertheless, the
Negro worker has definitely benefited under the open shop policy of the
steel corporations. And any departure from this policy should be
carefully examined to determine whether it would increase or decrease
these benefits.

> The Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel and Tin Workers is now
demanding recognition by the steel industries and is asking that the
government intercede in its behalf. Having carefully investigated the
efforts of the Amalgamated to organize the steel workers we are forced
to take the position that the organization of the industry by the A. F.
of L. will greatly decrease employment opportunities for Negroes.
Therefore, we feel that the administration should not intercede in
behalf of the union, especially since the union is discriminating
against Negro workers, and the Negro as a substandard worker definitely
merits the protection of the government.

> ... Our investigation indicates that many Negro steel workers have not been
invited to join the union by the union organizers.

> ... we have presented this memorandum and hope that you will not take
any action which might unfavorably affect the future of the Negro
worker.^[Letter sent to the Hon. Frances Perkins, Secretary of Labor, by the
industrial secretary of the Chicago Urban League, June 23, 1934. The
writer of this letter explained: "This letter, of course, only
represents the stand taken by our department. And I suppose I should
inform you that Mr. T. Arnold Hill of the National office is not in
accord with the contents of my letter, and feels rather strongly that I
should not have committed this office to the open shop policy of the
steel industry." (Letter, October 16, 1934.)]


Throughout the country only one League branch, as far as the author is
aware, helped in the drive for union membership under the N.R.A. In St.
Louis, after the passage of the blanket code, the Amalgamated Meat
Cutters and Butcher Workmen attempted to organize the meat packing
industry. The League was asked for assistance in getting Negroes
interested in the union. The industrial secretary of that branch
addressed several union meetings. From his point of view: "The League
envisages the unions as the only way out. When we find a union that is
O.K., we back it. ..." \[Interview (St. Louis, Mo.) November 21, 1934.\]
But even in this instance the executive secretary was not sure of his
ground.

> If Negroes get in an industry in large numbers, the A. F. of L. calls
for organization. As soon as they are organized the union gets together
and arbitrarily figures that the number of Negroes in the industry is
too large, and they gradually reduce the percentage of Negroes until
they squeeze most of them out and give the white men their jobs.
\[Interview (St. Louis, Mo.) November 21, 1934.\]

With the advent of the C.I.O. the National Urban League, although at
first it was both apathetic and rather suspicious, later took a more
active part in the movement. Lester B. Granger, secretary of the
Workers' Bureau of the National Urban League, cautioned Negro workers
against a headlong rush into the ranks of the C.I.O. However, the
attitude was considerably changed within a few months after the
committee had begun to function actively. In 1937 Granger wrote:

> A more modern social intelligence has been shown by C.I.O. leadership
than that shown by the old time A. F. of L. leaders. Steel, Auto, Mine
and Garment Workers' Unions have shown great concern not only for the
defense of civil rights, but also for protecting the welfare of the
unemployed and for organizing the unorganized.

> [410]{.pagenum}Since Negroes furnish so large a proportion of the unorganized, the
unemployed, and those whose civil rights are violated, they are quick to
see in the C.I.O. an instrument of deep importance to their race---a new
champion to defend the rights of the underdog.^[Lester B. Granger, "New Trade Union Movement of the Negro," *Workers' Council Bulletin*, No. 18.]

At the Pittsburgh conference of Negro steel workers, T. Arnold Hill,
stated:

> I can assure you ... wholehearted support of our national organization
\[the Urban League\], and that we are with you 100 per cent in this
drive to get Negroes into the Steel Workers' Union.^[49. *Steel Labor*, II (February 20, 1937), 5.]

On the important question of racial discrimination, a national officer
of the League stated: "We have not been able to observe instances of
discrimination against Negro membership in the C.I.O."^[50. Letter to the author, December 29, 1937 (from Reginald A. Johnson).] However, Hill
stated that he thought that the C.I.O. might "go in a little deeper for
Negro members than it has."

> However, ... the C.I.O. has been shortsighted because it has failed to
utilize the existing channels of information to reach the Negro. It
should call one or more persons to advise and consult as to ways and
means of getting more Negro members.

> So far as the National Urban League is concerned, we are wholeheartedly
in favor of Negro organization and are in many directions working to
bring this about.^[51. *Pittsburgh Courier*, August 19, 1937.]

Also there has been a decidedly more coöperative attitude demonstrated
toward the C.I.O. and its attempt to organize the steel workers by the
branches of the League than has ever been extended to the Amalgamated
Association. Perhaps the most active pro-C.I.O. branches have been those
in New York and St. Louis. The Industrial Department of the St. Louis
branch, under the direction of Sidney Williams and Arnold Walker, has
actively aided union organization not only in steel and meat packing but
in all other fields including the skilled crafts. These men were also
responsible for the formation of the St. Louis Negro Labor Congress to
inform and guide the bewildered Negro [411]{.pagenum}workers in the field
of union organization. As one observer stated: "The Negro educated
class, as a whole, is lying low, indifferent or out-spokenly anti-union.
By comparison, the Urban League of this city is radical in its labor
interests and activities."^[52. *Ibid*.]

Branches of the League in other cities have shown a varying amount of
interest and activity in the problem of organizing Negro workers under
the C.I.O. The Chicago branch changed, to an extent, its attitude and A.
L. Foster, executive secretary of the branch, made a public statement in
support of the Steel Workers' Organizing Committee. He appeared (with
Van A. Bittner, director of the Chicago area) on the program of a mass
meeting to draw more workers into the union.

In general, it may be said that the National Urban League and most of
its branches have felt much more friendly and have been willing to
coöperate more fully with the C.I.O. and the S.W.O.C. than they have
been with the Amalgamated Association. However, in this drive as in the
one under the N.R.A., the Urban League cannot be said to have played on
the whole an active or an aggressive part in encouraging Negroes to join
unions. The activities of the League are still confined to making rather
general favorable statements and to some form of workers' education.

Clearly the Urban League is an organization which cannot and should not
attempt to assume leadership in the trade union movement. It was
organized and equipped to function in the field of social service. It is
only because the Negro community has not developed any labor
organization that the League has been forced to step in and play a
leading role at the time of industrial difficulties. In the field of
social work it does commendable and important work but the control of
the employing class makes it ineffectual in trade union matters. The
League has often muddled important issues by interjecting into them the
social service instead of the trade union point of view. If it attempts
to assume leadership in the labor organization under its present
control, it may in some localities at least, again as [412]{.pagenum}in
the past be used as a weapon against a militant trade union movement.

### The N.A.A.C.P.

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is
essentially a civil rights organization; its sole significance in the
labor movement lies in the fact that it agitates for civil rights in the
industrial field. These are its objectives:

> The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People seeks to
uplift the colored men and women of this country by securing to them the
full enjoyment of their rights as citizens, justice in all courts and
equality of opportunity everywhere.^[Annual Report of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, issued January 1, 1911. According to Mr. Paul Baker,
"The N.A.A.C.P. has dealt more with the legal and political aspects
of the race question than has any agency with the possible exception of
the American Civil Liberties Union." (*Op. cit*., p. 45.)]

The Association has focused its attention on cases of discrimination
within the labor movement rather than on active organization of workers.
Its chief instrument of rectification has been the court, an institution
which has not been an asset in the attempt to further union
organization. It is unlikely that the Association could function in the
labor movement in any way other than to influence public opinion in both
Negro and white communities. Its administrative equipment is inadequate;
the paid staff consists of only twenty-six workers. All other officers
in the 325 branches are volunteers.^[54. Baker, *op. cit*., p. 44.] None of these people have been
trained in labor work and are for the most part upper class Negro
citizens who are not directly interested in organizing Negro laborers.

On various occasions the Association has made efforts to coöperate with
the American Federation of Labor. The 1924 convention of the Association
sent an open letter offering to provide half the funds for an
investigation of the problems of the Negro worker. In 1929 it made
another approach to the Federation, this time in connection with the
attempt to organize southern labor.

[413]{.pagenum}Upon learning of the plan of the American Federation of Labor to
organize in the South, the N.A.A.C.P. telegraphed the A. F. of L. annual
meeting during October in Toronto, Canada, as follows:

> Press dispatches state American Federation of Labor will discuss Tuesday
unionization of South. National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People renews its appeal that colored workers be fully and
completely included in your program, inasmuch as labor problems in South
can never be satisfactorily adjusted with Negroes excluded from unions.
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People also renews
offer to appoint joint committee with American Federation of Labor for
purpose of investigation needs of colored workers and working out plan
for unionization.

No direct reply was received from the A. F. of L., but it was noted
subsequently in the public press that the plans for organization in the
South did include organization of Negro workers.^[Twentieth Annual Report of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People for 1929 (New York City, January, 1930),
p. 23.]

During the recent attempt to organize industrial workers under the
impetus of the N.R.A., the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People did nothing at all to encourage Negroes to join. The
position of the Association is stated in a letter from Roy Wilkins,
assistant secretary of the national office:

> When the New Deal Program was launched, we realized as did all other
persons interested in the labor movement that Section 7-A of the
National Industrial Recovery Act was a powerful weapon for the workers
if they would use it and fight for the correct interpretation of it. We
came shortly to realize, however, that while the American Federation of
Labor was seizing upon Section 7-A to carry on the most stupendous drive
for membership in its history, it was doing little or nothing to include
Negroes in the organizing. As a matter of fact, we strongly suspect,
although we cannot prove, that A. F. of L. unions have attempted to use
Section 7-A to drive Negroes out of certain occupations.

>  The strategy was to organize a union for collective bargaining, to claim
the right to speak for all the workers, and then to either agree with
the employers to push Negroes out of the industry or,
[414]{.pagenum}having effected an agreement with the employer, to proceed
to make the union lily-white.

> For this reason and for others which have come up in the history of the
A. F. of L. we refrained from sending out any special word to Negro
workers on the A. F. of L. We did tackle the A. F. of L. itself at the
outset of the New Deal program communicating personally and by letter
with Mr. MacGrady and Mr. Green.

> We believe that the A. F. of L. is beginning to see the light. We
believe that it is now up to the Negro workers to test the A. F. of L.
pronouncements of no Jim Crow by seeking membership in all unions and by
bringing to the fore all cases of discrimination within the unions.

> It is not easy for an Association which knows so intimately the raw
deals that have been given Negro labor by the A. F. of L. to get out and
shout from the housetops to Negro workers urging them to affiliate. At
the same time we realize that affiliation would be best for all
concerned provided one did not have just as great a battle after getting
in the union as one had on the outside.^[56. Correspondence with the author, October 30, 1934.]

The growth of the C.I.O. resulted in the development of two rather
opposed points of view within the Association. As the C.I.O. did not
practice racial discrimination, the more liberal elements of the
Association were very favorable toward Negro participation in the
movement. However, the more conservative members of the Association were
prone to be antagonistic to the C.I.O. on the grounds that it was a
radical organization. It was only after some debate that the liberal
members were able to obtain permission for Homer Martin, president of
the United Automobile Workers, to address the national convention of the
N.A.A.C.P. in Detroit.

The local organizations were, for the most part, opposed to the
movement. The president of the Association in Chicago (in 1937) was
violently opposed to the C.I.O. which he characterized as a Communist
organization. George Schuyler has attributed to the head of the local
N.A.A.C.P. in Indianapolis the statement that, "I have come to the
conclusion Negroes had better stay out of the union." In Detroit,
Michigan, the same antagonisms were found. Although in a few instances
the National [415]{.pagenum}Association or one of its branches has called
attention to some form of discrimination which a union has been
practicing, there was no attempt on the part of the national
organization or any of its branches (as far as the writer has been able
to ascertain) to assist positively in organizing Negro workers.
Fundamentally, the explanation of the antagonism toward union
organizations in general and toward the C.I.O. in particular is to be
traced to the upper class composition and point of view of the members
and especially of the leadership of the Association.


### The National Negro Congress^[The author is indebted to Miss Hazel Hayes for much of the material on the National Negro Congress.]

In the first days of the N.R.A. it became apparent that there was no
organization in the Negro community capable of or interested in leading
the Negro workers of the country in a struggle to obtain the advantages
opened to them both as laborers and as members of a minority group.
Previous mention has been made of the Joint Committee on Recovery which
was organized by John P. Davis. This organization was a pressure group
which was hastily brought into existence in 1933 to present material
concerning Negro laborers at various code hearings. With the failure of
Negroes as a group to obtain protection against the wage differentials
in the various codes or successfully to participate in the union
organizational campaign of 1933 and 1934, a group of young intellectuals
in Washington, D.C., became convinced that a new type of organization
addressing itself to the economic problems of Negro industrial and
agricultural workers was necessary.

In May, 1935, a conference was sponsored by the Joint Committee on
Recovery and members of the Howard University teaching staff to discuss
some of the unfair practices which had arisen under the N.R.A. At this
economic conference plans were made for holding a National Negro
Congress at Chicago. A national sponsoring committee was organized and
Davis set out on a tour of the country for the purpose of rallying Negro
leaders to the cause of the Congress. The participation of church,
civic, political, and labor groups was solicited.

[416]{.pagenum}The objectives of the proposed Congress were outlined in a pamphlet by
Davis, entitled "Let Us Build A National Negro Congress."^[58. Washington, D. C, 1935.] Attention
was called in this publication to the problems confronting Negro
domestics, farmers, and laborers. Injustices under the N.R.A. were
described and the invasion of Ethiopia was cited as "another problem of
Black America." In this same publication A. Philip Randolph summed up
the potentialities of the Congress.

> On every fundamental problem, a ringing and militant declaration of
policy could be promulgated by such a Congress and since it would
represent the collective expression and will of millions of Negroes
embraced in their various organizations, government nor industry could
view it with indifference and unconcern.

In form the Congress was to be a "federation of forward-thinking
organizations in America ... \[to\] ... coordinate the struggle for
justice for the Negro."

> As more and more groups come to understand the vital need of joint
action and the tremendous value of working together, as they come
through such united action to a clearer and more friendly understanding
of each other, we may expect to see the National Negro Congress become
increasingly useful in the struggles of the Negro people in America.^[59. *Ibid*.]

As Randolph stated, the movement was really a "united front against
Fascism and repression of the rights of Negroes."

With the announcement of the plans for the Congress, the sponsoring
committee was able to obtain the support of a number of leaders in all
walks of life. Among those who indorsed the Congress were: Lester
Granger and Elmer A. Carter of the National Urban League, Doctor Ralph
Bunche, Doctor Alain Locke of Howard University, James W. Ford of the
Communist Party, Doctor M. O. Bousfield of the Julius Rosenwald Fund,
and Bishops James A. Bray, R. A. Carter, and W. J. Walls. There were in
addition many professional men, educators and social workers who gave
their initial blessing to the movement.

[417]{.pagenum}However, after the first enthusiastic response to the stirring call of
the sponsoring committee, the broad objectives and the obviously liberal
and even "radical" character of some of the supporters of the movement
had the effect of making many who had indorsed the Congress timid about
any further active participation. In addition, due to the facts that (1)
the organizations were unable, and when able, reticent, about putting
money into other organizations and (2) the Congress had not outlined a
program with the definiteness which would encourage sectarian
organizations to contribute money, the sponsoring committee found it
difficult to collect sufficient funds to finance the Congress. At this
point the Congress assumed a definitely interracial character as several
white organizations---trade union and political groups---contributed
funds, clerical help, and general aid. The direction of the Congress
remained under the influence of a "left wing" group ranging from faint
liberals and trade unionists to Communists. These were assisted by a few
prominent upper class representatives such as the Reverends Powell and
Jernagin, Bishop Bray, Reverend Archibald Carey, Jr., and Doctor Ralph
Bunche, who were not frightened by the liberal character of the
Congress.

The National Negro Congress officially opened February 14, 1936, at the
Eighth Regiment Armory in Chicago. Four general sessions were planned.
The first session was not held due to the failure or refusal of Mayor
Edward J. Kelly and Mr. Abbott, editor of the *Chicago Defender*, to
appear and give official sanction and welcome to the Congress. Adding
injury to this apparent insult the "red squad" from the Chicago Police
Department threatened to close the Congress almost before it opened on
the grounds that it was a "radical organization meeting for the purpose
of spreading a subversive doctrine." But for the diplomacy and tact of a
small group of Chicagoans, the Congress might have closed ignominiously.

The broad outline of the widely varied interests of the sponsors of the
Congress were set out in a paper prepared by A. Philip Randolph:

[418]{.pagenum}The issues should be obvious, clear and simple, such as prevention of
stoppage of relief, cuts in relief allotments, lay-offs of relief
workers, of workers in any industry, discrimination in the giving of
relief, exorbitant brutality, denial of free assembly, freedom of the
press, freedom of speech to unpopular groups; denial of civil rights to
Negroes such as the right to be served in hotels and restaurants, to
have access to public utilities, and forms of transportation, such as
Pullman cars.

> Wage struggles around the war upon Ethiopia by the Fascist dictator,
Mussolini, strikes and lock-outs of black and white workers, the
amendment to the federal constitution of the adopting of social
legislation such as the Retirement Pension Act for railroad workers,
fight for the freedom of Angelo Herndon, the Scottsboro boys, the
Wagner-Costigan anti-lynching bill, the violations of the Wagner Labor
Disputes bill, the forcing of teachers to take a loyalty oath, the
goose-stepping of students in the school system through the R.O.T.C, the
abolition of the color bar in trade unions, the murder of Shoemaker in
Tampa, Fla., exposing the menace of the American Liberty League, William
Randolph Hearst and the Ku Klux Klan, and supporting the movement of
John L. Lewis for industrial unionism.^[The keynote address of President A. Philip Randolph. The official proceedings of the National Negro Congress, Washington, D. C.]

For meeting these manifold and varied problems six general remedies were
suggested: (1) an organized struggle against fascism and war; (2) the
building of a powerful Negro civil rights organization; (3) movements to
improve the condition of sharecroppers and tenant fanners; (4) mass
consumers movements; (5) to intensify and broaden the movement to draw
Negro workers into labor organizations; (6) the development of an
independent working class political party.

It is interesting to examine the social composition of this group which
arrived at such a liberal, and for the Negro community such a radical
and inclusive, program. The geographic distribution of the delegates to
the Congress indicated that the body was largely drawn from northern
urban organizations. There were 817 delegates, representing 585
organizations, from 28 different states. Seven hundred and forty-three
of the del[419]{.pagenum}egates came from Illinois, Indiana, New York, Michigan, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Only *55* of the 817 delegates came from
the South. Eighty-one per cent of all delegates, then, came from
northern urban centers and 353 delegates or 43 per cent of the total
came from Chicago alone. Thus the Congress tended to represent the
northern urban as opposed to both the southern urban and the rural
population.

There were many different interest groups represented at the Congress.
Four hundred and forty-one or 75 per cent of the registered delegates
were from civic, educational, and religious groups; 15 per cent of the
delegates represented organizations which had definite economic programs
such as labor unions which comprised the majority of organizations in
this category; the other delegates came from other groups such as farm
organizations---two delegates; professional groups---six delegates; and
business organizations---two delegates. Although the delegates
representing the civic, educational, and religious groups were in the
great majority, they did not control the deliberations of the Congress.
In most cases neither the delegates nor the organizations they
represented held sharply defined social and economic views, while the
organizations representing the economic pressure groups, especially the
trade unions, had a well defined philosophy and were able to cope with
the program which had been arranged by the sponsoring committee. The
larger majority of the civic, educational, and religious groups
representatives were swept along by the enthusiasm of the economic
pressure group representatives to approve the well defined program of
the Planning Committee. The Congress, then, represented the northern
urban Negro population rather than the entire country and attempted to
express the interests of the urban industrial Negro workers.

It was obvious that a group with such diverse interests could not long
be held together on a program which included aid to Ethiopia, a campaign
for civil rights, the development of Negro business, and the
encouragement of the organization of Negro workers into trade unions.
The first group to break away were the preachers. They had been
antagonized by the fact that the [420]{.pagenum}representatives of the
civic, educational, and religious groups had had no place of importance
on the program. The principal speakers at the large meeting had been
such persons as A. Philip Randolph (represented by Charles Wesley
Burton) of the Brotherhood of Pullman Porters; Edward Strong,
vice-president of the American Youth Congress; James W. Ford of the
Communist Party; and Max Yergan of the International Committee of the
Young Men's Christian Association. At none of the general sessions did
the civic, educational, and religious groups have a principal speaker
with the exception of Rev. Archibald J. Carey, Jr., who was called upon
at the last minute to fill the gap created by the absence of Mayor Kelly
and Robert S. Abbott. This "oversight" so irked some of the clergy that
they wrote scathing denunciations of the Congress to the press. In the
February 21, 1936, issue of the *Chicago Defender*, three bishops---W.
J. Walls, J. A. Bray and R. A. Carter stated:

> We might pass over the fact that the church leaders were not consulted
in the original set up of such a movement but cannot overlook the truth
that with the exception of serving in sectional programs and making
invocations and pronouncing benedictions the church leaders, clergy and
lay, are entirely ignored in the program of the National Negro Congress.
This prevents the church which has the largest following of any
organized group among us from having any real part in shaping opinions
that may emanate from the Congress through the spread of delegate
influence and personal propaganda.

Some of the more conservative leaders in the group came forward to
criticize the Congress for its alleged "left wing" tendencies. Even
before the Congress met, Dr. Kelly Miller, a newspaper columnist and
former professor at Howard University, stated:

> The Conference must steer clear of Communism or of any brand of
radicalism out of harmony with the spirit and genius of American
institutions.^[61. *Chicago Bee*, February 13, 1936.]

In the issue following the meeting of the Congress, Miller stated:

> [421]{.pagenum}The National Negro Congress recently held in the city of Chicago was
primarily and fundamentally a leftward movement. The original suggestion
for such a Congress was made by James W. Ford, Vice-Presidential
candidate on the Communist ticket, at a session of the Coordinating
Committee held at Howard University last May. The suggestion was
ardently espoused and seconded by A. Philip Randolph, sometime editor of
the *Messenger*, a radical Negro magazine, which heads toward Moscow.

> ...

> The spirit of radicalism predominated throughout the proceedings. The
reds, the Socialists and Communists, were everywhere in ascendency,
either in number or indomitable purpose, or in both. The conservative
delegates who constituted a considerable proportion of the conference,
were either outnumbered or out-maneuvered.

In spite of these vitriolic criticisms the Congress proceeded to set up
the permanent national organization which had been outlined by the group
then in session. A. Philip Randolph had been elected chairman of the
national organization, John P. Davis, secretary and Marion Cuthbert,
treasurer. A national office was established in Washington, D. C, and
the country was divided into fifteen districts. The functions of the
districts were to obtain affiliations of both organizations and
individual members to the Congress, to raise funds, and to carry out the
program adopted at the convention. Units were immediately formed in such
industrial centers as Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, Gary, Detroit,
Pittsburgh, and San Francisco.

The enthusiasm aroused at the Congress was carried over into the first
few months following the close of the Conference. However, both the
local units and the national organization became the target for a great
deal of criticism from the more conservative leaders of the community
and as the Congress did not have any firm support from the masses of the
Negroes it soon felt the weight of this attack. In addition, the local
units were hampered by their lack of funds. With the antagonism of most
of the community leaders, especially the church and the press, the
apathy of the mass of Negroes, and the shortage of funds, neither the
local units nor the national organization was able to [422]{.pagenum}carry
out effectively the program which had been formulated at the Congress.
The local units dwindled in number and importance and only three or four
councils were able to maintain their existence, except on paper.

With the rise of the C.I.O. the Chicago chapter, at least, took on more
life. A close relationship was established between this unit of the
Congress and the C.I.O. and several of the paid Negro organizers were
recommended to the C.I.O. by the Congress. Among these were L. McDonald,
Henry Johnson, and Eleanor Rye of the S.W.O.C. A portion of these
organizers' salaries was at first paid by the National Negro Congress.
The Congress in Chicago and some of the other industrial centers was
also active in urging unionization of Negro workers and held mass
meetings and distributed leaflets and press releases to this end.
However, of all the councils originally set up, only those in New York,
Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh were able actually to survive and function
during the interim between the first and second Congress. The Chicago
council enjoyed intermittent spurts of life but consistently failed to
rally large numbers of Negroes to its support. It was evident that the
first National Negro Congress failed to meet the immediate issues of the
Negro group in any fashion which would have effected a national "united
front of all the elements in the Negro community in one concrete
program."

The second Negro Congress was called to meet in Philadelphia on October
15, 1937. The objectives of the Congress were much less inclusive than
had been those of the first. They included demands for decent jobs for
Negroes and the right to join unions; adequate relief and security for
needy families; support of the anti-lynch bill; and complete economic,
cultural, political, and social equality for Negro people. This session
of the Congress was much more successful in obtaining the coöperation of
many organizations and individuals who had not participated in the first
conference. Such important persons as Walter White, secretary of the
National Association of Colored People; Vito Marcontonio, former
Congressman from New York; Doctor Charles Wesley of Howard University;
President [423]{.pagenum}F. D. Patterson of Tuskegee Institute; Lieutenant
Governor Thomas J. Kennedy of Pennsylvania, and the secretary-treasurer
of the United Mine Workers of America; Doctor Harry F. Ward, chairman of
the League Against War and Fascism; Norman Thomas of the Socialist
Party; and I. Davis Wilson, Mayor of Philadelphia, appeared on the
program. The Congress received greetings from President Roosevelt and
Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia.

The second Congress followed much the pattern of the first. The 1218
delegates from various parts of the country adopted one hundred and
seventy-four resolutions covering the same variety of subjects. An
executive committee was elected with A. Philip Randolph as president,
John P. Davis as executive secretary, Gladys Stone as financial
secretary, U. Simpson Tate, treasurer, Max Yergan, director of the
International Committee on African Affairs, and Rev. William Jernagin of
Washington, D. C, as vice-president. The Congress went on record as
specifically opposed to the appointment of Justice Hugo L. Black to the
Supreme Court; it urged a million dollar federal housing fund; opposed
trade union dualism and endorsed the Committee on Industrial
Organization. Plans were made to hold the 1938 Congress in Detroit.

Many criticisms could be made of the program and character of the
National Negro Congress. It is open to serious question that a "united
front" of the various diverse and antagonistic elements in the Negro
community can arrive at a common program of action. Certainly a more or
less "left wing" program such as outlined by the Congress which
recommended a militant trade union, civil rights, and anti-fascist
policy would not suit the tastes of the conservative ministry and
professional men. Similarly, it is hard to envisage a program which
would simultaneously further the conflicting interests of the Negro
trade unionist and business man. And, although the Congress adopted many
resolutions concerning the evils which confront the Negro, they were not
in a position to offer a very concrete program for their abolishment. As
one writer stated: "They told the Negro what to do but not how to do it.
No adequate means or feasible [424]{.pagenum}agencies were established to implement and
make effective the high-sounding resolutions and pretentions."

In relation to the central problem of this discussion, *i.e*., how
Negroes may best be introduced into trade union organizations, the
Congress was effective in focusing the attention of the Negro community
on many fundamental social, economic, and political factors which
impinge upon the problem but it did not set up a concrete program and
machinery for the accomplishment of this end. Certainly the National
Negro Congress was not an organization which was dedicated solely to the
all-important end of organizing Negroes into unions. The National Negro
Congress can be thought of only as a very progressive and broad equal
rights organization and not unlike several other attempts at racial
solidarity. A movement dedicated to the single purpose of integrating
Negroes into the trade union movement has yet to be formed.
