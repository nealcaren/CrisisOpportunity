^[It should be emphasized that the term "upper class," when applied to Negroes, refers to the position of certain Negroes *within* the Negro community. The income, standard of living, cultural attributes, etc., of the Negro upper class is comparable probably to the "middle" section of the white middle class, rather than to the white upper class.]

13. A. Philip Randolph, in writing about the advanced positions of some
Negroes in the Pullman Company, asserted: "Anything which does not
benefit the rank and file of porters is no benefit at all. Such is the
case with the porters who have been given big jobs in the Pullman
offices at big salaries. Those jobs only benefit the job holders and the
company, not the Pullman porters. The jobs are only given to impress the
porters with the idea that the company is doing something for them; that
it has an interest in them. *They are jokers*. For they only help to
chloroform the porters and keep them from organizing. Don\'t look to the
Negroes holding jobs in the company for a remedy. They cannot speak out.
They dare not speak out. If they do they will lose their jobs." \["The
Case of the Pullman Porter," *The Messenger*, VII, (July, 1925), 255.\]

30. In a regional conference, the following memorandum was given to
local secretaries: "However, we have been handicapped several times in
our efforts because we have not been able to present a combined front
with our local organizations. The National cannot have the prestige when
its efforts arc weakened by the apathy and neglect of the local branch."

36. The question might arise---should one encourage membership in the
American Federation of Labor, in the left-wing unions of the Communist
Party, or in the Socialist labor unions? This is entirely a matter of
local consideration. In some instances, the left-wing unions remain the
only ones in which one may expect the development of this bargaining
power among Negro workers.... In the main, however, the most highly
developed form of labor organization expressing this policy of
collective bargaining is found in the regular American labor unions,
such as those affiliated with the American Federation of Labor."
