> A modified form of slavery survives wherever prison labor is sold to
private persons for their pecuniary profit.--*Wines.*

Two systems of controlling human labor which still flourish in the South
are the direct children of slavery, and to all intents and purposes are
slavery itself. These are the crop-lien system and the convict-lease
system. The crop-lien system is an arrangement of chattel mortgages so
fixed that the housing, labor, kind of agricul<span class="pagenum">738</span>ture and, to some extent,
the personal liberty of the free black laborer is put into the hands of
the landowner and merchant. It is absentee landlordism and the
"company-store" systems united and carried out to the furthest possible
degree. The convict-lease system is the slavery in private hands of
persons convicted of crimes and misdemeanors in the courts. The object
of the present paper is to study the rise and development of the
convict-lease system, and the efforts to modify and abolish it.

Before the Civil War the system of punishment for criminals was
practically the same as in the North. Except in a few cities, however,
crime was less prevalent than in the North, and the system of slavery
naturally modified the situation. The slaves could become criminals in
the eyes of the law only in exceptional cases. The punishment and trial
of nearly all ordinary misdemeanors and crimes lay in the hands of the
masters. Consequently, so far as the state was concerned, there was no
crime of any consequence among Negroes. The system of criminal
jurisprudence had to do, therefore, with whites almost exclusively, and
as is usual in a land of scattered population and aristocratic
tendencies, the law was lenient in theory and lax in execution.


On the other hand, the private well-ordering and control of slaves
called for careful cooperation among masters. The fear of insurrection
was ever before the South, and the ominous uprising of Cato, Gabriel,
Vesey, Turner, and Toussaint made this fear an ever-present nightmare.
The result was a system of rural police, mounted and on duty chiefly at
night, whose work it was to stop the nocturnal wandering and meeting of
slaves. It was usually an effective organization, which terrorized the
slaves, and to which all white men
belonged, and were liable to active detailed duty at regular intervals.


Upon this system war and emancipation struck like a thunderbolt. Law and
order among the whites, already loosely enforced, became still weaker
through the inevitable influence of conflict and social revolution. The
freedman was especially in an anomalous situation. The power of the
slave police supplemented and depended upon that of the private masters.
When the masters' power was broken the patrol was easily transmuted into
a lawless and illegal mob known to history as the Ku Klux Klan. Then
came the first, and probably the most disastrous, of that succession of
political expedients by which the South sought to evade the consequences
of emancipation. It will always be a nice question of ethics as to how
far a conquered people can be expected to submit to the dictates of a
victorious foe. Certainly the world must to a degree sympathize with
resistance under such circumstances. The mistake of the South, however,
was to adopt a kind of resistance which in the long run weakened her
moral fiber, destroyed respect for law and order, and enabled gradually
her worst elements to secure an unfortunate ascendency. The South
believed <span class="pagenum">739</span>in slave labor, and was thoroughly convinced that free Negroes
would not work steadily or effectively. The whites were determined after
the war, therefore, to restore slavery in everything but in name.
Elaborate and ingenious apprentice and vagrancy laws were passed,
designed to make the freedmen and their children work for their former
masters at practically no wages. Some justification for these laws was
found in the inevitable tendency of many of the ex-slaves to loaf when
the fear of the lash was taken away. The new laws, however, went far
beyond such justification, totally ignoring that large class of freedmen
eager to work and earn property of their own, stopping all competition
between employers, and confiscating the labor and liberty of children.
In fact, the new laws of this period recognized the Emancipation
Proclamation and the Thirteenth Amendment simply as abolishing the
slave-trade.

The interference of Congress in the plans for reconstruction stopped the
full carrying out of these schemes, and the Freedmen's Bureau
consolidated and sought to develop the various plans for employing and
guiding the freedmen already adopted in different <span class="pagenum">740</span>places under the
protection of the Union army. This government guardianship established a
free wage system of labor by the help of the army, the striving of the
best of the blacks, and the cooperation of some of the whites. In the
matter of adjusting legal relationships, however, the Bureau failed. It
had, to be sure, Bureau courts, with one representative of the
ex-master, one of the freedman, and one of the Bureau itself, but they
never gained the confidence of the community. As the regular state
courts gradually regained power, it was necessary for them to fix by
their decisions the new status of the freedmen. It was perhaps as
natural as it was unfortunate that amid this chaos the courts sought to
do by judicial decisions what the legislatures had formerly sought to do
by specific law -- namely, reduce the freedmen to serfdom. As a result,
the small peccadillos of a careless, untrained class were made the
excuse for severe sentences. The courts and jails became filled with the
careless and ignorant, with those who sought to emphasize their
new-found freedom, and too often with innocent victims of oppression.
The testimony of a Negro counted for
little or nothing in court, while the accusation of white witnesses was
usually decisive. The result of this was a sudden large increase in the
apparent criminal population of the Southern states -- an increase so
large that there was no way for the state to house it or watch it even
had the state wished to. And the state did not wish to. Throughout the
South laws were immediately passed authorizing public officials to lease
the labor of convicts to the highest bidder. The lessee then took charge
of the convicts -- worked them as he wished under the nominal control of
the state. Thus a new slavery and slave-trade was established.

## The Evil Influences

The abuses of this system have often been dwelt upon. It had the worst
aspects of slavery without any of its redeeming features. The innocent,
the guilty, and the depraved were herded together, children and adults,
men and women, given into the complete control of practically
irresponsible men, whose sole object was to make the most money
possible. The innocent were made bad, the bad worse; women were outraged
and children tainted; whipping and torture were in vogue, and the
death-rate from cruelty, exposure, and overwork rose to large
percentages. The actual bosses over such leased prisoners were usually
selected from the lowest classes of whites, and the camps were often far
from settlements or public roads. The prisoners often had scarcely any
clothing, they were fed on a scanty diet of corn bread and fat meat, and
worked twelve or more hours a day. After work each must do his own
cooking. There was insufficient shelter; in one Georgia camp, as late as
1895, sixty-one men slept in one room, seventeen by nineteen feet, and
seven feet high. Sanitary conditions <span class="pagenum">741</span>were wretched, there was little or
no medical attendance, and almost no care of the sick. Women were
mingled indiscriminately with the men, both in working and sleeping, and
dressed often in men's clothes. A young girl at Camp Hardmont, Georgia,
in 1895, was repeatedly outraged by several of her guards, and finally
died in childbirth while in camp.

Such facts illustrate the system at its worst -- as it used to exist in
nearly every Southern state, and as it still exists in parts of Georgia,
Mississippi, Louisiana, and other states. It is difficult to say whether
the effect of such a system is worse on the whites or on the Negroes. So
far as the whites are concerned, the convict-lease system lowered the
respect for courts, increased lawlessness, and put the states into the
clutches of penitentiary "rings." The courts were brought into politics,
judgeships became elective for shorter and shorter terms, and there grew
up a public sentiment which would not consent to considering the desert
of a criminal apart from his color. If the criminal were white, public
opinion refused to permit him to enter the chain-gang save in the most
extreme cases. The result is that even to-day it is very difficult to
enforce the laws in the South against whites, and red-handed criminals
go scot-free. On the other hand, so customary had to become to convict
any Negro upon a mere accusation, that public opinion was loathe to
allow a fair trial to black suspects, and was too often tempted to take
the law into their own hands. Finally
the state became a dealer in crime, profited by it so as to derive a new
annual income for her prisoners. The lessees of the convicts made large
profits also. Under such circumstances, it was almost impossible to
remove the clutches of this vicious system from the state. Even as late
as 1890 the Southern states were the only section of the Union where the
income from prisons and reformatories exceeded the
expense.^[Bulletin No 8, Library of the State of New York. All figures in this article are from this source.]
Moreover, these figures do not include the county gangs where the lease
system is to-day most prevalent and the net income largest.

The effect of the convict-lease system on the Negroes was deplorable.
First it linked crime and slavery indissolubly in their minds <span class="pagenum">742</span>as simply
forms of the white man's oppression. Punishment, consequently, lost the
most effective of its deterrent effects, and the criminal gained pity
instead of disdain. The Negroes lost faith in the integrity of courts
and the fairness of juries. Worse than all, the chain-gangs became
schools of crime which hastened the appearance of the confirmed Negro
criminal upon the scene. That some crime and vagrancy should follow
emancipation was inevitable. A nation can not systematically degrade
labor without in some degree debauching the laborer. But there can be no
doubt but that the indiscriminate careless and unjust method by which
Southern courts dealt with the freedmen after the war increased crime
and vagabondage to an enormous extent. There are no reliable statistics
to which one can safely appeal to measure exactly the growth of crime
among the emancipated slaves. About seventy per cent of all prisoners in
the South are black; this, however, is in part explained by the fact
that accused Negroes are still easily convicted and get long sentences,
while whites still continue to escape the penalty of many crimes even
among themselves. And yet allowing for all this, there can be no
reasonable doubt but that there has arisen in the South since the war a
class of black criminals, loafers, and ne'er-do-wells who are a menace
to their fellows, both black and white.

The appearance of the real Negro
criminal stirred the South deeply. The whites, despite their long use of
the criminal court for putting Negroes to work, were used to little more
than petty thieving and loafing on their part, and not to crimes of
boldness, violence, or cunning. When, after periods of stress or
financial depression, as in 1892, such crimes increased in frequency,
the wrath of a people unschooled in the modern methods of dealing with
crime broke all bounds and reached strange depths of barbaric vengeance
and torture. Such acts, instead of drawing the best opinion of these
states and of the nation toward a consideration of Negro crime and
criminals, discouraged and alienated the best classes of Negroes,
horrified the civilized world, and made the best white Southerners
ashamed of their land.


## What Has Been Done

Nevertheless, in the midst of all this a leaven of better things had
been working and the bad effects of the epidemic of lynching quickened
it. The great difficulty to be overcome in the South was the false
theory of work and of punishment of wrong-doers inherited from slavery.
The inevitable result of a slave system is for a master class to
consider that the slave exists for his benefit alone -- that the slave
has no rights which the master is bound to respect. Inevitably this idea
persisted after emancipation. The black workman existed for the comfort
and profit of white people, and the interests of white people were the
only ones to be seriously considered. Consequently, <span class="pagenum">743</span>for a lessee to work
convicts for his profit was a most natural thing. Then, too, these
convicts were to be punished, and the slave theory of punishment was
pain and intimidation. Given these ideas, and the convict-lease system
was inevitable. But other ideas were also prevalent in the South; there
were in slave times plantations where the well-being of the slaves was
considered, and where punishment meant the correction of the fault
rather than brute discomfort. After the chaos of war and reconstruction
passed, there came from the better conscience of the South a growing
demand for reform in the treatment of crime. The worst horrors of the
convict-lease system were attacked persistently in nearly every Southern
state. Back in the eighties George W. Cable, a Southern man, published a
strong attack on the system. The following decade Governor Atkinson, of
Georgia, instituted a searching investigation, which startled the state
by its revelation of existing conditions. Still more recently Florida,
Arkansas, and other states have had reports and agitation for reform.
The result has been marked improvement in conditions during the last
decade. This is shown in part by the statistics of 1895; in that year
the prisons and reformatories of the far South costs the states
\$204,483 more than they earned, while before this they had nearly
always yielded an income. This is still the smallest expenditure of any
section, and looks strangely small beside New England's \$l,190,564. At
the same time, a movement in the right direction is clear. The laws are
being framed more and more so as to prevent the placing of convicts
altogether in private control. They are not, to be sure, always
<span class="pagenum">744</span>enforced, Georgia having several hundreds of convicts so controlled in 1895 despite the law. In nearly all
the Gulf states the convict-lease system still has a strong hold, still
debauches public sentiment and breeds criminals.

![**A Country Chain-Gang in Alabama.**](Images/DuBois_1901_Spawn-2.jpg)

The next step after the lease system was to keep the prisoners under
state control, or, at least, regular state inspection, but to lease
their labor to contractors, or to employ it in some remunerative labor
for the state. It is this stage that the South is slowly reaching to-day
so far as the criminals are concerned who are dealt with directly by the
states. Those whom the state still unfortunately leaves in the hands of
county officials are usually leased to irresponsible parties. Without
doubt, work, and work worth the doing -- *i.e.,* profitable work -- is
best for prisoners. Yet there lurks in this system a dangerous
temptation. The correct theory is that the work is for the benefit of
the criminal -- for his correction, if possible. At the same time, his
work should not be allowed to come into unfair competition with that of
honest laborers, and it should never be an object of traffic for pure
financial gain. Whenever the profit derived from the work becomes the
object of employing prisoners, then evil must result. In the South
to-day it is natural that in the slow turning from the totally
indefensible private lease system, some of its wrong ideas should
persist. Prominent among these persisting ideas is this: that the most
successful dealing with criminals is that which costs the state least in
actual outlay. This idea still dominates most of the Southern states.
Georgia spent \$2.38 per capita on her 2,938 prisoners in 1890, while
Massachusetts spent \$62.96 per capita on her 5,227 prisoners. Moreover,
by selling the labor of her prisoners to the highest bidders, Georgia
not only got all her money back, but made a total clear profit of \$6.12
on each prisoner, Massachusetts spent about \$100,000 more than was
returned to her by prisoners' labor. Now it is extremely difficult,
under such circumstances, to prove to a state that Georgia is making a
worse business investment than Massachusetts. It will take another
generation to prove to the South that an apparently profitable traffic
in crime is very dangerous business for a state; that prevention of
crime and the reformation of criminals is the one legitimate object of
all dealing with depraved natures, and that apparent profit arising from
other methods is in the end worse than dead loss. Bad public schools and
profit from crime explain much of the Southern social problem. Georgia,
Florida, and Louisiana, as late as 1895, were spending annually only
\$20,799 on their state prisoners, and receiving \$80,493 from the hire
of their labor.


Moreover, in the desire to make the labor of criminals pay, little heed
is taken of the competition of convict and free laborers, unless the
free laborers are white and have a vote. Black laborers are continually
displaced in such industries as brick-making, mining, road-<span class="pagenum">745</span>building,
grading, quarrying, and the like, by convicts hired at \$3, or
thereabouts, a month.


The second mischievous idea that survives from slavery and the
convict-lease system is the lack of all intelligent discrimination in
dealing with prisoners. The most conspicuous and fatal example of this
is the indiscriminate herding of juvenile and adult criminals. It need
hardly be said that such methods manufacture criminals more quickly than
all other methods can reform them. In 1890, of all the Southern states,
only Texas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Maryland, and West Virginia made any
state appropriations for juvenile
reformatories. In 1895 Delaware was added to these, but Kentucky was
missing. We have, therefore:


|                 | 1890     | 1895     |
|-----------------|--------:|---------:|
| New England     | $632,634 | $854,581 |
| Border States   | 233,020  | 174,781  |
| Southern States | 10,498   | 33,910   |


And this in face of the fact that the South had in 1980 over four
thousand prisoners under twenty years of age. In some of the Southern
states -- notably, Virginia -- there are private associations for
juvenile reform, acting in cooperation with the state. These have, in
some cases, recently received state aid, I believe. In other states,
like Georgia, there is permissive legislation for the establishment of
local reformatories. Little has resulted as yet from this legislation,
but it is promising.

---

I have sought in this paper to trace roughly the attitude of the South
toward crime. There is in that attitude much to condemn, but also
something to praise. The tendencies are to-day certainly in the right
direction, but there is a long battle to be fought with prejudice and
inertia before the South will realize that a black criminal is a human
being, to be punished firmly but humanely, with the sole object of
making him a safe member of society, and that a white criminal at large
is a menace and a danger. The greatest difficulty to-day in the way of
reform is this race question. The movement for juvenile reformatories in
Georgia would have succeeded some years ago, in all probability, had not
the argument been used: it is chiefly for the benefit of Negroes. Until
the public opinion of the ruling masses of the South can see that the
prevention of crime among Negroes is just as necessary, just as
profitable, for the whites themselves, as prevention among whites, all
true betterment in courts and prisons will be hindered. Above all, we
must remember that crime is not normal; that the appearance of crime
among Southern Negroes is a symptom of wrong social conditions -- of a
stress of life greater than a large part of the community can bear. The
Negro is not naturally criminal; he is usually patient and law-abiding.
If slavery, the convict-lease system, the traffic in criminal labor, the
lack of juvenile reformatories, together with the unfortunate
discrimination and prejudice in other walks of life, have led to that
sort of social protest and revolt which we call crime, then we must look
for remedy in the sane reform of these wrong social conditions, and not
in intimidation, savagery, or the legalized slavery of men.
