<p><span class="pagenum">74</span> Prior to the Civil War there was not,
in the South, the problem of Negro crime such as now exists. Although at
that time each of the slave states had elaborate and severe laws for
dealing with Negro criminals, they were, in proportion to the total
number of Negroes, comparatively few. Immediately following
emancipation, however, their numbers increased. This was inevitable; for
many of the restraints that had been about the slaves were suddenly
removed and much of the machinery for state and local government had
broken down. As a result there was confusion and disorder. Many of the
slaves left the plantations. There was the beginning of the migration
from section to section from the rural districts to the cities and from
the South to the North. Under all these circumstances it was not
surprising that there should be an increase in Negro crime. The wonder
is that there was not more confusion, disorder and rapine. The great
majority of the freedmen did not attempt to be lawless. They exercised
the same restraint that they had exercised during the four years that
their masters had been away on the field of battle. But to some of the
newly enfranchised, freedom meant the license to do what they pleased.
It was from this class that the majority of the criminals came.</p>
<p>As an example of the increase in the number of Negro criminals, we
will take the state of Georgia. In 1858, there were confined in the
Georgia penitentiary 183 prisoners, all of whom were apparently white.
Twelve years later, in 1870, there were 393 prisoners in this
penitentiary, of whom 59 were white and 334 colored.</p>
<p>According to the United States census, the total number of Negroes
confined in Southern prisons in 1870 was 6,031; ten years later, the
number, 12,973, had more than doubled; twenty years later, the number,
19,244, was three times as great; thirty-four years later, however, that
is in 1904, the number of Negroes confined in Southern prisons was
18,550. This would appear to indicate that, <span
class="pagenum">75</span> so far as prison population is an index, Negro
criminality in the South in recent years has not increased. It is
probable that there is some decrease, for a study of criminal statistics
of cities North and South, indicates that between 1890 and 1904 Negro
criminality, which up to this time had seemed to be steadily increasing,
reached its highest point and began to decrease. It appears that the
decrease began about 1894-1895.</p>
<p>The number of prisoners per 100,000 of Negro population also appears
to bear out this conclusion. It also shows that there is a much higher
rate of crime among Negroes in the North than in the South. This is to a
large extent due to the fact that seven-tenths of the Negroes in the
North, as against one-tenth in the South, live in cities and are of an
age when persons have the greatest tendency to crime.</p>
<p>In the following table the number of Negro prisoners in Northern and
Southern states is compared.</p>

<p>It is significant that the number of lynchings reached its highest
point about the same period that Negro crime reached its highest point.
From 1882 to 1892 the number of persons lynched annually in the United
States increased from 114 to 255. From that time on the number
decreased. In 1912, there were 64 lynchings in the United States. The
total number of lynchings during the thirty years from 1882 to 1912 were
4,021. Of this number, 1,231 were whites and 2,790 were Negroes. The
average per year for Negroes was 93, for whites, 41. From 80 to 90 per
cent of the lynchings are in the <span class="pagenum">76</span> South.
Less than one-fourth of the lynchings of Negroes is due to assaults upon
women; in 1912 only one-fifth was for this cause. The largest per cent
of lynchings is for murder or attempted murder. Over 10 per cent is for
minor offenses.</p>
<p>It is of still greater interest to compare the commitments for rape.
In 1904, the commitments for this crime per 100,000 of the total
population were: all whites, 0.6; colored, 1.8; Italians, 5.3; Mexicans,
4.8; Austrians, 3.2; Hungarians, 2.0; French, 1.9; Russians, 1.9. Of
those committed to prison for major offenses in 1904 the per cent
committed for rape was, for colored, 1.9; all whites, 2.3; foreign
white, 2.6; Irish, 1.3; Germans, 1.8; Poles, 2.1; Mexicans, 2.7;
Canadians, 3; Russians, 3; French, 3.1; Austrians, 4.2; Italians, 4.4;
Hungarians, 4.7. The commitments for assaults upon women are low in the
Southern States. In the south Atlantic division the rate per 100,000 of
the population in 1904, was 0.5; in the south central division it was
0.7. Some would suppose that the low rate of commitments for rape in the
South is due to the fact that the most of the perpetrators of these
crimes are summarily lynched; but if, however, all the Negroes who were
lynched for rape in the South were included, the rate for colored would
be changed less than one-fourth of 1 per cent.</p>
<p>The report of the immigration commission in 1911 on <em>Immigration
and Crime</em> gives the following concerning the per cent that rape
forms of all offenses by Negroes and whites: of convictions in the New
York City court of general sessions for nine months of 1908-1909, Negro,
0.5; foreign white, 1.8; native white, 0.8. Chicago police arrests from
190,5-1908, Negro, 0.34; foreign white, 0.35; native white, 0.30; of
alien white prisoners, 1908, in the United States, 2.9.</p>
<p>Both North and South the crime rate for Negroes is much higher than
it is for whites. In 1904 the commitments per 100,000, in the entire
country, were, for whites, 187; for Negroes, 268. In the Southern
States, Negro crime compared with white is in the ratio of 3½ to 1. On
the other hand it is interesting to find that the Negro has a relatively
lower crime rate than several of the emigrant races who are now coming
to this country. The following table shows the commitments to prison, in
1904, per 1,000, of certain nationalities:</p>

<p>As a result of emancipation and the increase in Negro crime, great
changes were brought about in the prison systems of the South. Before
the war the states of the South operated their prisons on state account
and they were generally a burden on the states. After the close of the
war the states found themselves with an increasing prison population and
no resources from which to make appropriations for the support of these
prisons. Throughout the South there was great demand for labor. Inside
the prisons were thousands of able-bodied Negroes. Offers were made to
the states by those needing labor to lease these prisoners, and so it
was discovered that what had been an expense could be converted into a
means of revenue and furnish a source from which the depleted state
treasuries could be replenished. Thus it came about that all the
Southern state prisons were either by the military governments or by the
reconstruction governments, put upon lease.</p>
<p>The introduction of the convict lease system into the prisons of the
South, thereby enabling the convicts to become a source of revenue,
caused each state to have a financial interest in increasing the number
of convicts. It was inevitable, therefore, that many abuses should
arise. In his report for 1870, less than a year after the Georgia lease
had been effected, the principal keeper of the penitentiary complained
about the treatment of the convicts by the lessees. An investigation in
1875 of the Texas system revealed a most horrible condition of affairs.
From time to time in other states there were attacks on the systems and
legislative investigations. The better conscience of the South demanded
reform in the treatment of criminals for it was found that “the convict
lease system had made the condition of the convict infinitely worse than
<span class="pagenum">78</span> was possible under a system of slavery
in which the slave belonged to his master for life.” In recent years
there has been much improvement in the condition of convicts in the
South. Five states, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, Oklahoma and Texas
have abolished the lease, contract, and other hiring systems. All the
other Southern states still sell convict labor to some extent, but in
each of these strong movements are on foot to abolish the custom.</p>
<p>After the close of the war and as a part of the reconstruction of the
South there had to be some readjustment of court procedure with
reference to Negroes. Hitherto they had been dealt with as slaves or as
free persons of color. After the adoption of the war amendments, they
came before the courts as full citizens of the United States. From now
on, much of the time, in many sections, the major part of the time of
the criminal courts has been taken up with trying cases where Negroes
were concerned.</p>
<p>Before emancipation the Negro had noted that wherever the law had
been invoked with reference to a Negro that it was generally to punish
or to restrain. Thus he came to view the law as something to be feared
and evaded but not necessarily to be respected or to be sought as a
means of protection. Under freedom the Negro’s experience with the law
was much the same as it had been in slavery. He found that the courts
were still used as a means of punishment and restraint and that
generally they were not the place to seek for protection. Another cause
of the Negroes regarding the courts unfavorably was the stringent laws
relating to labor contracts. These laws imposed severe penalties upon
the laborer who violated his contract and often reduced him to peonage.
The result is that at present the attitude of the Negroes toward the law
is that many still associate laws with slavery and look upon courts as
places where punishment is meted out rather than where justice is
dispensed.</p>
<p>This brings us to the question whether the Negroes are fairly tried
in the courts. Judge W. H. Thomas, of Montgomery, Ala., after an
experience of ten years as a trial judge, in an address before the
Southern Sociological Congress, at Nashville, in 1912, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My observation has been that courts try the Negro fairly. I have
observed that juries have not hesitated to acquit the Negro when the
evidence showed his innocence. Yet, honesty demands that I say that
justice too often miscarries in the attempt to enforce the criminal law
against the native <span class="pagenum">79</span> white man. It is not
that the Negro fails to get justice before the courts in the trial of
the specific indictment against him, but too often it is that the native
white man escapes it. It must be poor consolation to the foreign-born,
the Indian, the Negro and the ignorant generally to learn that the law
has punished only the guilty of their class or race, and to see that the
guilty of the class, fortunate by reason of wealth, learning or color,
are not so punished for like crime. There must be a full realization of
the fact that if punishments of the law are not imposed on all offenders
alike, it will breed distrust of administration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hon. William H. Sanford, also of Montgomery, Ala., in an address
before the same congress on “Fundamental Inequalities of Administration
Of Laws,” further illuminated this question. He pointed out that the
real population of the South is made up of three distinctive
communities:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First where the population is composed largely of Negroes, sometimes
in the ratio of as many as ten to one. Second, where the population is
largely white, usually at a ratio of about two to one. Third, where the
population is almost entirely white. In the first of these, in the
administration of the criminal law, the Negro usually gets even and
exacts justice, sometimes tempered with mercy. The average white man who
serves on the juries in these counties, in his cooler moments and
untouched by racial influences, is a believer in fair play, and for the
most part is the descendant of the men who builded the foundation of our
states. But in these communities, a white man rarely, if ever, gets a
fair and an impartial trial, and, if indeed he is indicted by a grand
jury, his conviction or acquittal is determined more upon his family
connections, his business standing or his local political influence than
upon the evidence in the case as applied to the law. In the second of
these communities the law is more nearly enforced as to both classes,
and except in cases where the rights of the one are opposed to those of
the other, convictions may be had, and indeed are often had, against the
members of both races for offenses of the more serious nature. In the
third of these communities the white man usually gets a fair trial and
is usually acquitted or convicted according to the evidence under the
law, while the Negro, the member of an opposite race, has scant
consideration before a jury composed entirely of white men, and is given
the severest punishments for the most trivial offenses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion what are some of the principal factors of Negro
criminality in the South? The convict lease system has already been
indicated as one of these factors. Another factor is the imposing of
severe and sometimes unjust sentences for misdemeanors, petty offenses
and for vagrancy. Still another factor is the lack of <span
class="pagenum">80</span> facilities to properly care for Negro juvenile
offenders. Ignorance is, by some, reckoned as one of the chief causes of
Negro crime. The majority of the serious offenses, such as homicide and
rape, are committed by the ignorant. It appears to be pretty generally
agreed that one of the chief causes of Negro crime in the South is
strong drink. Attention was called to this fact by the great falling off
in crime in those sections of the South where the prohibition law was
put into effect. The general testimony is that where prohibition has
really prohibited the Negro from securing liquor, the crime rate has
decreased; where, however, the prohibition law has not prevented the
Negro from securing liquor, there has been no decrease in the crime
rate, but, instead, the introduction of a cheaper grade of liquor
peddled about in the city and in the country districts, appears to have
tended to increase crime.</p>
<p>One of the most significant and hopeful signs for the satisfactory
solution of the race problem in the South is the attitude that is being
taken towards Negro crime. The Negroes themselves are trying to get at
the sources of crime and are making efforts to bring about better
conditions. In some sections they have law and order leagues working in
cooperation with the officers of the law. The white people are also
giving serious consideration to Negro crime. Its sources, causes and
effects upon the social life of the South are being studied. Movements
are on foot for bettering conditions. Under the leadership of the late
ex-Governor W.J. Northern, of Georgia, Christian civic leagues, composed
of colored and white persons, were organized in that and other states
for the purpose of putting down mob violence. The Southern Sociological
Congress is taking the lead for the abolition of the convict lease and
contract systems and for the adoption, in the South, of modern
principles of prison reform.</p>
