<p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract: </strong>Negro labor made its
earliest significant shift from field to factory in the first notable
industry in the South, the manufacture of tobacco. The Negro eagerly
sought employment in the industry and throughout the period of slavery
held high a monopoly of tobacco work establishing a fixed association of
Negroes and tobacco. With each advance in machinery there has been an
increase in white male and female labor, and Negro workers have held
only those jobs secured to them by low wages, disagreeable dust, and by
tasks regarded as too heavy for native-born white Americans. The Negro
worker is by tradition to “stay in his place,” but his place is being
continually narrowed. The race tradition with its ritual of segregation,
regarded by white workers as natural and by the Negro workers as
traditional, is used by the industry to keep the two groups actively and
impotently in conflict. The present working relation of constant
bickering and confusion does not present a solid labor front competent
to bargain with capital.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum">55</span></p>
<p>Tobacco holds a unique place in American history. It was the first
commercial staple crop of any consequence, and its manufacture became
the first notable industry in the South. It helped to shape the social
as well as the economic institutions of the colony of Virginia and,
through the export trade with England, ultimately supplied an economic
basis for American independence itself. Despite its ultimate value as a
commercial crop, tobacco production would have scarcely had the economic
importance it so early gained without the slave labor which multiplied
its profits. Thus began an early and significant association of Negro
labor with the commodity, which extended from cultivation of the plant,
through the stages of leaf preparation, to the manufacture of the
finished commodity.</p>
<p>Just as free labor drove out slavery in Pennsylvania, where there was
no such suitable commercial staple, slavery drove out free and
indentured labor in Virginia, where a staple crop flourished. The
tobacco factories in Richmond, Petersburg, and Lynchburg early became
commercial institutions of no little importance in the life of the state
and of the region. An interesting feature of these early industries was
the transfer of Negro labor from field to factory. Negro labor, slave
and free, performed a large share of the manufacturing work.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">56</span> One of the effects of slavery was to
leave the Negro at emancipation with a more or less complete monopoly of
certain types of labor. Some of these were trades requiring a very
considerable degree of skill. Certain tasks which had been customarily
performed by Negroes during slavery were regarded, after slavery had
been abolished, as Negro jobs which no white man could perform without
some loss of caste.</p>
<p>The effect of slavery was to attach a social stigma to almost any
kind of manual labor, but especially that which required patient
submission to a fixed routine, and to the arbitrary control of the
overseer or his successor, the boss.</p>
<p>If the stigma of slave work provided a certain protection to Negro
workers against the competition of free white labor, tobacco
manufacturing differed from other kinds of slave work in so far as it
afforded the Negroes engaged in it some social distinction, and some
opportunities they did not have elsewhere. It differed from plantation
work in being an urban industry, and in being in immediate dependence
upon a money economy. Leased slaves earned a weekly wage, even though
they could not appropriate it. Free Negroes found in it one uncontested
source of income, and slaves, by overtime work and wages, could at times
purchase their own freedom. Lott Carey, the Negro missionary who
distinguished himself in the Liberian colonization movement, purchased
himself and his wife in this manner. The widely known Negro minister,
John Jasper, who antedated Voliva in his fervent conviction that the sun
revolved about the earth, was converted in a tobacco factory.</p>
<p>The story of John Jasper, who grew up before the Civil War, throws a
great deal of light upon the character of the relations in the factories
in this earlier period. He was a stemmer and, in his own words, could
outstem any hand in the place. At his bench one day, after weeks of
brooding, he became hysterical with religious emotion. The foreman, who
was one of the poor white class, was unsympathetic. The owner, on the
other hand, whom he called “Mars Sam,” although more his employer than
his owner, was an ardent Baptist, and was deeply moved by Jasper’s
conversion and, weeping with him, gave him a holiday to communicate his
fervor to anyone else who would listen.</p>
<p>The cold and not infrequently hostile relations between the Negro
<span class="pagenum">57</span> and the propertyless white class had,
characteristically, its offset in the white propertied group in this
industry, and the relations between white proprietor and the Negro
laborer were comparable to the familiar relations of domestic slave and
master. Indeed, during the early history of the industry Negroes were on
a more comfortable basis with the owners than with the white workers,
because they were actually a part of the owners’ capital. Free white
workers were in competition with the owners for a share of this wealth.
This fact is significant because it is an incident of the long, though
silent, competition of Negro labor, under the institution of slavery,
with free white labor. The occupational restriction which slavery and
caste imposed upon the Negro tended to give work in tobacco a special
dignity. Negroes sought this occupation, and in it they were free to
rise, within limits. It was an occupation which their children
inherited. Habits of life were more or less adjusted to the demands of
the industry. Moreover, in this work they had some sort of vested
interest.</p>
<p>Throughout the period of slavery the Negro workers held high monopoly
of the tobacco work, even though only a comparatively few received
personal profit from it. So well established had this association been
that it survived, only slightly altered, for many years after the legal
status of the Negro laborer had changed with the transition from slavery
to freedom. Hogshead-handlers, prizers, pickers, searchers, and stemmers
remain today almost exclusively Negroes. Before the industry had gained
its present rational organization and technical complexity, there were
other hand processes besides stemming, involving a certain amount of
skill, which were performed by Negroes. Under these conditions
exceptional dexterity brought them a higher wage than any other industry
was capable of yielding. In 1860, for example, tobacco factories in
Petersburg and Richmond, Virginia, paid leased or free Negro laborers
about $225 a year in addition to their keep. In fact, one Negro worker
is reported to have earned as much as $900 in a single year. Twenty
years after the close of the war certain classes of Negro workers in the
factories were receiving from $9.00 to $14.50 a week—amounts exceeding
the level of Negro earnings in industry today under conditions of open
competition.</p>
<p>Considering its unique history, the tobacco industry offers a
pecu<span class="pagenum">58</span>liarly interesting illustration of
the character assumed by the class struggle when complicated by racial
antagonisms and caste tradition. A class struggle is implicit in the
free competition on which capitalism and the capitalistic organization
of industry is based. But in the early period of the tobacco industry
the classes had all the features and limitations of a caste. New
conditions inherent in the industry itself, and changes in the formal
status of the Negro workers, have created conditions under which typical
economic classes have developed and are now seeking to function. In the
tobacco manufacturing industry, with its white and Negro workers, the
class alignment, because of the persistence of the caste tradition, has
been imperfectly achieved. Social habits and customs change less rapidly
than artifacts and the division of labor incidental to the expansion of
industry.</p>
<p>A modern industry is too complex and changes too rapidly to sustain a
caste system. The progressive substitution of machinery for hand
processes has created new tasks and destroyed old and honorable skills.
With each advance in machinery there has been an increase in white male
and female labor. Lacking the protection of that caste sentiment which
preserved to the Negro jobs in which he once seemed to have some sort of
vested interest, these workers have found themselves holding only those
jobs which were “secured” to them by low wages, disagreeable dust, and
by tasks regarded as too heavy for native-born white Americans.</p>
<p>Curiously enough, the existing racial division in work is
rationalized by both white and Negro workers in essentially the same
terms. A white worker who had come into one of the factory towns some
years before from farm labor explained the racial division of labor as
something having a biological basis. He said: “The niggers handle the
dirty work. A white man couldn’t get in there. The niggers always done
the heavy, hot work. They stand it better.”</p>
<p>In like manner, a Negro prizer, doing heavy work, assumed that these
jobs fell to Negroes because they alone could sustain them. He said:
“The white men work alongside of us, but they do the light and we do the
heavy work. They couldn’t do the kind of work we do. We go carrying
around iron racks weighing from ninety pounds up. That would kill the
whites.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">59</span> But this same man was confused by
reports of a different situation in a region which, incidentally, lacked
the race and caste tradition of the Old South. He said: “They tell me
that the white man does the prizing work in St. Louis, where they work
all whites, but these kinds of whites couldn’t stand this work. No,
Sir!”</p>
<p>If the exigencies of the economic system have given Negroes and
whites the common interests of members of the same economic class,
traditions supported by the familiar racial fictions and enforced by
racial etiquette have continued to maintain the moral isolation of the
races. It is the undercurrent of hostility which this isolation of the
two groups inevitably fosters and the festering suspicions, which are
more or less justified by the use which can be made of this internal
conflict by the industry itself, that keep these two groups actively and
impotently in conflict.</p>
<p>One of the most widespread expressions of prevailing racial attitudes
is racial segregation. Segregation, even enforced by distinctions that
are little more than symbolic, is regarded as of vital importance to the
normal equilibrium, and, generally, to the best interests of both races.
The traditional racial sentiments are shared fully and felt deeply by
the workers, and especially by the white workers, who regard the
practice of segregation as essential not merely to their own economic
security but also to their racial and social status. The Negro workers,
more or less resigned to their station, seek for themselves whatever
security they can gain from a less exacting wage scale, from the
uncomplaining performance of disagreeable tasks, from the moral support
which casual personal relations with employers afford them, and from
occasional benevolent sentiments of the more influential elements of the
white population. The significance of this triangular relationship
between the Negro, the employer group, and the white-worker group
occasionally finds expression in embittered comment like that of a white
worker who accused one firm of favoring Negroes. He said: “They like the
nigger better, pay him less, treat him worse, kick and cuss him around,
and the nigger’ll take it.”</p>
<p>In carrying out the traditional racial policy segregation of workers
is practiced in most of the plants, but the form varies widely between
plants, according to circumstances. The most common and wide<span
class="pagenum">60</span>spread form is the natural one, which follows
the racial division of occupations. As noted earlier, the Negroes
perform most of the work up to the point of manufacture and the white
workers most of the work from fabrication to the market. That this
occupational segregation is more a matter of caste and custom than of
skill and capacity is indicated by the fact that there are numbers of
white stemmers, traditionally a Negro’s job, in Louisville, and of Negro
making-machine operators, ordinarily a white man’s job, in Winston-Salem
and other cities.</p>
<p>All the supervisory posts are held by white workers, except in one
notable instance in Louisville, where there are Negro foreman over Negro
workers. White workers hold practically all the jobs in the plants
classified as standard crafts. Negroes hold practically all the jobs
regarded as menial, such as general-labor, porters’, and cleaners’
jobs.</p>
<p>A variety of types of physical segregation exists. In some
instances—as, for example, in many of the Richmond plants—there are
entirely separate buildings for the different races. In Winston-Salem,
Durham, and Reidsville segregation is effected by separation, allocation
of Negro and white workers to different workrooms, even when the
occupational tasks are not different; sometimes by assignment of these
groups to separate sides of the same room, and even by separate rows in
the same room. The principle of racial separation is preserved in plants
in at least two cities by day and night shifts. In that case a white and
a Negro group do the same work on the same machines but are employed on
different shifts. In one instance the Negro workers had the preferred
shift.</p>
<p>Not all processes adjust themselves easily to strict racial
separation. While broad occupational divisions are possible, there are
yet other kinds of work with divergent requirements, for parts of which
Negroes prove more useful. For example, on one plant on the same
machines Negroes sacked while whites booked, and at another Negroes
tagged while whites changed the knives, and in still another plant
Negroes were hopper-feeders on machines operated by white men. When a
heavy and a light task, or a pleasant and a disagreeable task, are
combined, there may be racial segregation of the tasks without spatial
separation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">61</span> There are conditions under which
spatial segregation is not feasible, as when two connected processes are
so close that they must be performed in the same room. A single Negro
may be given a machine at the end of a room in which all other operators
are white. Or, again, in one case noted the spirit of segregation may be
appeased by providing separate doors to the same workroom.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that, although practically many forms of
segregation are employed, in every case the particular form in use at a
time and place is regarded by white workers as part of the natural
order, and by the Negro workers as traditional and unalterable. Race
relations in the plant rest with a certain finality upon the customary
basis, whatever it may be. Moreover, on certain types of segregated work
the rationalizations in terms of special racial abilities and instincts
are made and adopted by the workers themselves, although these
assumptions are frequently not in accord with the facts. A white worker
in Richmond expressed the opinion that it would cause a race war if a
Negro were put on a machine, but there are actually not only in Richmond
but in the other cities covered by a recent investigation some Negroes
on machines.</p>
<p>To preserve proper relations it is deemed most important to the white
workers that Negro workers “keep their place.” This refers not merely to
the Negro’s place in the occupational hierarchy but to the necessity of
maintaining the social and ceremonial distance between which local
custom prescribes. At a Durham plant a white worker objected to the fact
that white and Negro packers worked together on the same task: “You see,
the southern man knows how to get along with the niggers. If they don’t
stay in their place you take a club and kill ’em. Of course they
shouldn’t work together in this way.”</p>
<p>Another white worker, a union member, further revealed the caste
motive in the present racial attitude of some white workers when he
said: “I wouldn’t work with niggers on the same kind of work. I don’t
think a nigger ought to make as much as a white man. It just won’t do.
Give a nigger a little money and he’s a ‘big Ike’ right then. He’d want
to come to the same cafes you do. You can’t reason with a nigger when
he’s got a little bit of money in his pocket.”</p>
<p>Far from the ideal of a solid labor front competent to bargain with
<span class="pagenum">62</span> capital, the present working relation is
one of constant bickering, flux, and confusion. The more highly
developed the establishment, the more complex the race relations,
because of the difficulty of enforcing the racial etiquette in each new
situation created by internal physical adjustments. In the smaller and
industrially less elaborated establishments racial sentiments are less
disturbed by technological and organizational changes.</p>
<p>In one plant, for example, there is a white night shift and a Negro
day shift working on the same machines. The white workers wanted the day
shift and the Negroes wanted the white pay rates. In another plant three
white girls were displaced by Negroes. In one plant the white workers
were certain that a riot would result if Negroes were ever put on
machine work. In an adjoining plant they were on machines, and under
another company nearly a hundred Negroes were placed on machines without
an outbreak. In this case it was said all the workers were afraid of the
foreman. The Negroes have, in some instances, complained about “poor
whites” from the country, willing to begin at less than even the Negro
scale of pay. The white workers, in another instance, complained that an
old “fogey” superintendent “wouldn’t give the white boys a break.”</p>
<p>Effective labor organization is, under the circumstances, impossible.
Negroes heartily distrust the white union members, and not without
reason. The white workers distrust the Negro’s understanding of union
principles, and his disposition to submit to union discipline. What is
more important, they are unwilling to have Negro workers receive the
same pay for the same kind of work. As one of them put it: “Give a
nigger the same money, and he gets uppity; he’ll want to come in a cafe
and eat with you.”</p>
<p>The closest approach to traditional union policy that the white
unionists were willing to concede was separate closed shops. This is
another expression of the policy of separate unions. The comment of a
white worker on this proposal was: “They never will get as much as us
though. The Company couldn’t afford that.” However, during the worst
year of the depression the company was able to pay dividends of over
$1,500 per worker over the average of $600 which the workers earned in
wages.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">63</span> Just as there are many forms of
segregation maintained without protest, so there are instances of the
absence of it, similarly without evidence of difficulty. In
Winston-Salem there are divisions of plants in which whites and Negroes
work side by side as pickers, cappers, machine operators, and stemmers.
Again, during the Christmas rush, it is customary to have groups work
together. Recent readjustments during the past year have prompted
compression or reorganization of tasks, resulting in the breaking-down
of the racial alignment. Where a particularly strong foreman wills it,
the arrangement is set in either direction, and none of these
arrangements appears to have provoked any abnormal situation. Two
significant comments are noted on this modification of traditional
policy. Said a worker in one of the Winston-Salem plants: “The poor
whites and niggers is worked together up at No.——. They is using the
poor whites to whip the nigger and the nigger to whip the poor whites.
If the poor whites sort of get out of line, they fire them and put
niggers in their jobs, and they do the niggers the same way.” The
observation by a Negro worker was to the effect that they are all “hard
off and can’t complain.”</p>
<p>In one plant there has been an instance of the displacement of a
white by a Negro gang, and in two other plants the shifting upward of a
Negro to a more skilled task alongside white workers, without changing
the designation of his task or his pay.</p>
<p>One situation making for tolerance of a non-segregated working
arrangement is the present work shortage, which, however, results
frequently in the displacement of Negro workers. Types of work long
regarded as “Negro jobs” are being increasingly sought by white workers,
and these workers not only make no objection but seek apprentice
opportunities among Negro workers. This is very pro<span
class="pagenum">64</span>nounced in Louisville, where a Negro,
commenting upon the appearance of a newly mixed gang, said: “No white
man did my kind of work till lately. They just like us, kinda poor and
they want to stay. They all want to keep a job here now and they’s all
right. The other superintendent didn’t let white men come down on our
gang, but this one does. He’s from South Carolina. Sometime they send
white men down to work on our gang when they ain’t nothing doing much on
another floor.”</p>
<p>There are at least three angles to the problem of what jobs Negroes
should have and what jobs the whites should have, (1) There is the angle
of the Negroes who need the jobs they have always had as a livelihood.
(2) There is the angle of the whites who, unemployed at former
occupations, seek jobs in the tobacco industry. (3) There is the
employer’s angle of least cost.</p>
<p>In the first case the principle of seniority and the development of
skills would allow for continued employment of Negroes in old jobs. As
new jobs developed, Negroes and whites would be employed according to
their several abilities to acquire the new skills. This would mean that
where, for instance, all stemmers had been Negroes, these Negroes would
be retained as stemmers with Negro replacements. When a change in the
industry developed a new job, Negroes would have equal opportunity to
qualify and fill the new jobs with whites. This first angle is given the
least consideration of any.</p>
<p>In the second case there are numerous white workers who formerly were
occupied in other jobs, but who are now unemployed and seek tobacco
jobs—in fact, any they can get. Jobs have been classified traditionally
in a loose manner, according to respectability, as Negro jobs and white
jobs. There remains a tendency to stick to this traditional division,
but the pressure of circumstances has continually lowered the lower
margin of respectability. Whereas twenty years ago work in a tobacco
factory was considered degrading to a white person, unless employed in a
supervisory or similar capacity, there are now white women stemmers.
Such occupations remained for a long time exclusively Negro tasks.</p>
<p>With the coming of cigarettes and machine processes, new jobs, or at
least different jobs, were created. Although in many cases the jobs are
not much different as regards respectability, sanitary condi<span
class="pagenum">65</span>tions, hours, and facilities, the fact that
these are new allows them to be classed as white jobs, from which Negro
workers may be excluded.</p>
<p>There is not much difference between stemming and searching in this
respect. Yet, in one large plant, all stemmers are Negroes and all
searchers are white. The only difference is a margin of status in case
of the searchers. Searching follows stemming, and the searchers can
check on the stemmers rather than be checked on by the stemmers. This,
now, permits it to be classed as a white job. In most places all machine
operators and cigarette makers are white. In many cases where the
conception of what constitutes a Negro job has been strictly construed,
Negro jobs have been reduced to that of janitor, or limited to such
heavy work as handling hogsheads. The Negro worker is by tradition to
stay in his place, but his place is being continually restricted.</p>
<p>The third angle is that of the employer who is inevitably constrained
by the necessity of getting the most work done at least cost. Another
race differential complicates his problem. Whatever a Negro earns at a
given job, a white worker, according to the prevailing custom, should
get more. Whatever the general standard of living of the Negroes is,
that of the white workers is expected to be higher. There is in the end
no real reason why the employer should pay more wages to white workers
when he can get the same work done by Negroes at a lower labor cost. He
is, nevertheless, continually faced with the pressure of white workers
for jobs, and these workers insist that Negroes be paid less.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>This wide discrepancy between the annual wage of the
workers and the annual profit of the industry per wage-earner suggests a
question which has been often asked but never satisfactorily answered.
It is this: Was the Negro laborer better off in slavery than he is today
in freedom? As far as concerns the tobacco industry, it is possible to
make some sort of answer. Slavery, in any case, gave the Negro a
security he does not possess today. It is probable that the capital
investment of the manufacturer, even where he owned his own laborers,
was not as great in proportion to the number of laborers employed as it
is today. However, the laborer’s share in the earnings of the industry,
small as it may have been, was probably greater, proportionately, before
emancipation than it is today.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"
