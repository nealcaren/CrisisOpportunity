<p><span class="pagenum">488</span>The more or less theoretical problem
of race prejudice to-day enters largely into the domain of practical
politics, and has become of increasing importance in the United States
not only because it involves to the Negro in large sections of the
country a denial of the principles of democracy, thus engendering
passionate feelings against such discrimination, but on account of the
unwisdom from an economic standpoint of repressing the colored
races.</p>
<p>We have in the United States to-day a series of rotten boroughs or
districts, the political power of which is tremendously and unfairly
increased by the wholesale disfranchisement of their voters, until one
man in Georgia or Mississippi often exercises as much power in the
counsels of the National government as seven men in Massachusetts.
Moreover, these Southern voters have had their political power increased
so enormously, not because of political efficiency (since they are the
most illiterate part of the Nation), but because strong racial prejudice
has led them to deny the right to vote to black men. There has been some
pretense of letting a few competent blacks vote, but as the new Senator
from Mississippi says boldly, “There is to-day no such thing as Negro
suffrage in Mississippi and never will be as long as the white men of
the State stand together.” Thus a second political complication enters.
The all-powerful rump of the voting population of the South can not
to-day consider the merits of any political question presented to them.
They must vote always and simply to keep negroes down. Outside of all
questions of party such a denial of the fundamental principles of
democracy is dangerous to the Nation. It means that there are certain
parts of the country where reason can not be applied to <span
class="pagenum">488</span> the settlement of great political questions.
Such weak spots in the political body are sure to become the seat of
disease, and so long as the race prejudice in the South shows its result
in such disorganization of government and disfranchisement of a large
part of the working class and in an unequal balance of political power,
as compared with the rest of the Nation, just so long race prejudice is
bound to be a burning question of practical politics.</p>
<p>The question, however, is not simply political, it is not simply the
old question of the negro’s right to vote,—a problem which has been with
us so long that we are disposed to give it up in despair. Today the
problem is becoming more and more economic. We are seeing arise in the
South two great groups of laborers: one white and one black, one with
the power of the ballot and one disfranchised. That the disfranchisement
of the black workingmen is practically complete there can be no
reasonable doubt. These two groups of workingmen are coming more and
more into economic competition, and the industrial education of the
negro is bound to increase this competition. The result is a situation
which is being taken advantage of by two different kinds of selfish
interests. The politician in the South who is out of a job finds it more
and more to his interest to stir up the passions of the white workingman
who has the ballot by appealing to the grossest and worst instincts of
race prejudice, and by representing all the present and possible
economic ills of the white workingman as due to his black competitor. We
have already seen in the South instance after instance of demagogues
arising with wide-spread political power by these means and we have
known the horror of the Atlanta riot as a sort of first-fruits of this
newer economic race danger.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the exploiting capitalist is also tempted to
transmute race prejudice in the coin of the realm. He says to his white
laborers, “I am not in business for my health; I seek the cheapest
competent labor. Larger and larger number of blacks are demanding work
at low wages; if you are dissatisfied and continue to make trouble and
demand too much I will replace you by black men.” He turns to his black
laborers, “You are lazy and incompetent—unless you work harder and stop
complaining I will replace you with white men.” This again leads each
class to regard the other as the chief cause of low wages and unfair
treatment; and the situation in the South affects the labor problem over
the whole nation, and is destined to affect it more and more. The high
level of wages in the North can not entirely <span
class="pagenum">490</span> withstand the competition of the lower level
of wages in the South, and fight as the white laborer may at once to
keep up wages and to exclude the black man from his union, he is bound
to lose for he is fighting black men, while black men are fighting
starvation and must consequently fight harder. So that here again we
have a result of race prejudice which is bringing us face to face with a
great labor problem.</p>
<p>But the results of race prejudice do not stop even here. The United
States is today going through a great economic crisis. It is changing
from being a country which raises and exports food stuffs and imports
its manufactured articles, into a country which largely consumes its own
food stuffs and exports its manufactures. Now the export of food from
the United States brought us into contact with European civilization,
but the export of manufactured articles is bringing us into contact with
the darker world; with Asia, Africa, the West Indies and South America.
In our endeavor, however, to open markets for trade in these countries
and with these peoples we are being brought face to face with the
unpleasant fact that America is not liked in the darker world; she has
gone out of her way to insult many of these people. She has enslaved
“Niggers,” sneered at “Dagos,” insulted Chinese and Japanese, and found
no words too contemptuous to express her feeling for the “mongrel” races
of Central and Southern America. Under such circumstances our invasion
of the world market must be under a great moral handicap. There can be
no doubt but that a large part of our difficulty in getting South
American trade is because of our free exhibition of racial prejudice. In
China and the East our prejudices have not helped our economic campaign,
and the future is ominous.</p>
<p>Viewing then the situation calmly and judicially, it must frankly be
confessed that race prejudice is costing the United States heavily: it
is costing us certain fundamental principles of democratic government,
peace and development in the labor world, and enhanced difficulty of
getting a world market for our goods.</p>
<p>Facing now such a cost, it is reasonable to ask, Why are we paying
it? What return are we getting out of it? Is it really worth while? Most
people when asked about their prejudices as to race say simply: it is a
matter of personal like or dislike; some people like one kind of people
and some another, similar to a preference for one sort of food over
another. The difficulty is, however, that human antipathies between men
and men <span class="pagenum">491</span> seldom remain at this
comparatively harmless stage. The preferences take on a vitality and
warmth, a value and importance that makes us not satisfied to indulge
our likes and dislikes, but to wish to force them on our neighbors and
to this end we are nearly always driven, or think we are driven, to use
three weapons of offence, which are in the world history of tremendous
import. These are: personal insult, persecution and repression.</p>
<p>We forcibly keep certain men from occupying certain positions or
entering certain careers. We deliberately persecute some people by
means, for instance, of Jim-Crow cars or other discriminations, or we
heap personal insult and ridicule upon them. It may be admitted that
there are perhaps times in this world when it is necessary and
defensible to take a human being by the throat, slowly choke his life
out and throw his dead carcass to one side; or if we are not prepared
personally to go to that extreme, it is, I am told, at times justifiable
to render the life of certain persons so uncomfortable that they will
eliminate themselves; and finally it certainly seems to many as though
personal insult was now and then necessary to repress some sorts of
undesirable men; but despite all this, every civilized being hesitates
and shudders at the use of these three awful weapons; and they hesitate
because these weapons are dangerous things, not simply deadening,
corroding, fatal to the victims, but doubly dangerous to those who get
into the habit of using them; from the use of insult grows the arrogant,
overbearing nation which so often blindly misses the way of truth; from
the bigotry of persecution grows the dead rot of mental death, and from
war and murder comes national as well as individual death. Worse than
that, these weapons of race prejudice often fail to effect their object.
Doubtless objectionable individuals and groups have been persecuted and
insulted out of existence or simply massacred. But not always. Often
with fierce persistence they have lived, directly or
indirectly—consciously or unconsciously to avenge their wrongs. At least
these weapons of offense are so despicable and their efficiency so
questionable that before we continue their use, ought we not to ask
ourselves frankly: just what it is that we really want to accomplish in
this matter of racial prejudice?</p>
<p>I think that most people would say upon first thought that they want
to be able to live in a world which is in most respects according to
their liking and according to their idea of fitness, both in persons and
in things; but so soon as such a desire is expressed, it must be said
plainly, without further argument, that <span class="pagenum">492</span>
such a consummation is largely impossible. The simplest and most
exclusive club can not in its membership suit all the people included.
We must always come more or less in contact, even in intimate contact,
with people whom we do not like. This is true of all ages, but it is
especially true in the modem world. A few centuries ago the world
existed in such air-tight compartments that groups could isolate
themselves and live to themselves. Today we are demanding vociferously
the policy of the Open Door. We are demanding, now chiefly for economic
reasons, but also in part for political and social reasons, a world-wide
contact of men with men. It is expressed to-day in the right of white
men to go anywhere they choose and be treated with consideration and
respect. It will be expressed to-morrow in the right of the colored
races to return the visits. Under no easily conceivable circumstances
can the future world be peopled simply with one of the present social
groups or with one of the existing races. Some people, to be sure, dream
of a future white world. A glance at any map or newspaper will prove
that this is, to say the least, highly improbable. Today the human race
throughout the world contains a vast numerical preponderance of colored
peoples and the population among these colored races is probably
increasing faster than among the whites, so that in the future the
aggregate of the Black and Yellow races may outnumber the white
race.</p>
<p>Many people would frankly acknowledge this. They would expect a
future world of Black and Yellow and White men. But they say: we wish
these several races to be kept in their places.</p>
<p>Here again there arise difficulties. What are the respective places
of these races? Is the easily assumed hierarchy composed by Ruling
White, Servile Black and Docile Yellow men really the last word in
social evolution? History is not reassuring on this point, present
tendencies are disconcerting, and Science is helplessly spreading its
hands. Wise men acknowledge that it is perfectly possible that Black and
Yellow men may yet reach and surpass white civilization. This may not
seem probable, but in human history the Improbable has often
happened.</p>
<p>But let all this be as it may, certain it is that if by natural
constitution the great races of men arrange themselves in a hierarchy of
ability, efficiency and development, then no such social weapons as are
now used by racial prejudice are necessary to reinforce natural law.
Education will keep the superior races <span class="pagenum">493</span>
from degeneracy by intermarriage far better than organized insult;
persecution will be quite unnecessary to eliminate such races as are
unable to survive under civilized conditions; and Repression of ambition
and ability will be attended to by the law of social gravity much more
effectively than by “Jim-Crow” legislation. In fine, why should we
threaten the efficiency of government, the development of industry and
the peace of the world by imperfect and questionable human devices?</p>
<p>So soon as the prejudiced are forced into this inevitable dilemma,
then the real bitterness and indefensibleness of their attitude is apt
to be revealed; they say bluntly that they do not care what “Niggers,”
“Dagos,” “Chinks,” or “Japs” may be capable of—they do not like them and
they propose to keep such folk in a place of permanent inferiority to
the white race—by peaceful policy if possible, by brute force if
necessary. And when a group, a nation or a world assumes this attitude,
it is handling dynamite. <em>There is in this world no such force as the
force of a man determined to rise.</em> The human soul can not be
permanently chained.</p>
<p>Is it not then of supreme importance that here in America we refuse
to aid and abet any such attempt and that we refuse to try to hold back
by insult, persecution and repression those dark masses of human beings
who, though beaten to their knees and bloody with blows, are still
doggedly determined to be men?</p>
<p>In view of all this it is a matter not simply of politics but of the
widest and broadest statesmanship, of economic foresight and deepest
religious thought to see that race prejudice in the United States is
combatted and corrected and lessened.</p>
<p>The first and most obvious corrective is intelligence. Today it is
both significant and natural that in those parts of the United States
where illiteracy is greatest, racial prejudice is most furious,
uncompromising and blood-thirsty. Would it not be a wise step to follow
the suggestion of Dr. Felix Adler and others and revive the Blair bill:
to enact a national law by which Federal aid should be given to free
common school education in all states where illiteracy exceeds a certain
minimum percentage, and continue to be given so long as such excess
continues? I can not conceive of any more statesmanlike action than this
and no action of greater promise. Let us then, as a first step toward
fighting the baneful effects of race prejudice in America and in the
world, <em>revive the Blair hill</em>.</p>
