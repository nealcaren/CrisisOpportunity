<p><span class="pagenum">1</span>The present period in the development
of sociological study is a trying one; it is the period of observation,
research and comparison—work always wearisome, often aimless, without
well-settled principles and guiding lines, and subject ever to the
pertinent criticism: What, after all, has been accomplished? To this the
one positive answer which years of research and speculation have been
able to return is that the phenomena of society are worth the most
careful and systematic study, and whether or not this study may
eventually lead to a systematic body of knowledge deserving the name of
science, it cannot in any case fail to give the world a mass of truth
worth the knowing.</p>
<p>Being then in a period of observation and comparison, we must confess
to ourselves that the sociologists of few nations have so good an
opportunity for observing the growth and evolution of society as those
of the United States. The rapid rise of a young country, the vast social
changes, the wonderful economic development, the bold political
experiments, and the contact of varying moral standards—all these make
for American students crucial tests of social action, microcosmic
reproductions of long centuries of <span class="pagenum">2</span> world
history, and rapid—even violent—repetitions of great social problems.
Here is a field for the sociologist—a field rich, but little worked, and
full of great possibilities. European scholars envy our opportunities
and it must be said to our credit that great interest in the observation
of social phenomena has been aroused in the last decade—an interest of
which much is ephemeral and superficial, but which opens the way for
broad scholarship and scientific effort.</p>
<p>In one field, however,—and a field perhaps larger than any other
single domain of social phenomena, there does not seem to have been
awakened as yet a fitting realization of the opportunities for
scientific inquiry. This is the group of social phenomena arising from
the presence in this land of eight million persons of African
descent.</p>
<p>It is my purpose in this paper to discuss certain considerations
concerning the study of the social problems affecting American Negroes;
first, as to the historical development of these problems; then as to
the necessity for their careful systematic study at the present time;
thirdly, as to the results of scientific study of the Negro up to this
time; fourthly, as to the scope and method which future scientific
inquiry should take, and, lastly, regarding the agencies by which this
work can best be carried out.</p>
<h2 id="development-of-the-negro-problems">Development of the Negro
Problems</h2>
<p>A social problem is the failure of an organized social group to
realize its group ideals, through the inability to adapt a certain
desired line of action to given conditions of life. If, for instance, a
government founded on universal manhood suffrage has a portion of its
population so ignorant as to be unable to vote intelligently, such
ignorance becomes a menacing social problem. The impossibility of
economic and social development in a community where a large per cent of
the population refuse to abide by the social rules of order, makes a
problem of crime and lawlessness. <span class="pagenum">3</span>
Prostitution becomes a social problem when the demands of luxurious home
life conflict with marriage customs.</p>
<p>Thus a social problem is ever a relation between conditions and
action, and as conditions and actions vary and change from group to
group from time to time and from place to place, so social problems
change, develop and grow. Consequently, though we ordinarily speak of
the Negro problem as though it were one unchanged question, students
must recognize the obvious facts that this problem, like others, has had
a long historical development, has changed with the growth and evolution
of the nation; moreover, that it is not one problem, but rather a plexus
of social problems, some new, some old, some simple, some complex; and
these problems have their one bond of unity in the act that they group
themselves about those Africans whom two centuries of slave-trading
brought into the land.</p>
<p>In the latter part of the seventeenth and early in the eighteenth
centuries, the central and all-absorbing economic need of America was
the creation of a proper labor supply to develop American wealth. This
question had been answered in the West Indies by enslaving Indians and
Negroes. In the colonies of the mainland it was answered by the
importation of Negroes and indented servants. Immediately then there
arose the question of the legal status of these slaves and servants; and
dozens of enactments, from Massachusetts to Georgia, were made “for the
proper regulation of slaves and servants.” Such statutes sought to solve
problems of labor and not of race or color. Two circumstances, however,
soon began to differentiate in the problem of labor, problems which
concerned slaves for life from those which concerned servants for
limited periods; and these circumstances were the economic superiority
of the slave system, and the fact that the slaves were neither of the
same race, language nor religion as the servants and their masters. In
laboring classes thus widely separated there naturally arose a
difference in legal and <span class="pagenum">4</span> social standing.
Colonial statutes soon ceased to embrace the regulations applying to
slaves and servants in one chapter, and laws were passed for servants on
the one hand and for Negro slaves on the other.</p>
<p>As slave labor, under the peculiar conditions of colonial life,
increased in value and efficiency, the importations of Africans
increased, while those of indented servants decreased; this gave rise to
new social problems, namely, those of protecting a feeble civilization
against an influx of barbarism and heathenism. Between 1750 and 1800 an
increasing number of laws began to form a peculiar and systematic slave
code based on a distinct idea of social caste. Even, as this slave code
was developing, new social conditions changed the aspect of the
problems. The laws hitherto had been made to fit a class distinguished
by its condition more than by its race or color. There arose now,
however, a class of English-speaking Negroes born on American soil, and
members of Christian churches; there sprang from illicit intercourse and
considerable intermarriage with indented servants, a number of persons
of mixed blood; there was also created by emancipation and the birth of
black sons of white women a new class of free Negroes: all these
developments led to a distinct beginning of group life among Negroes.
Repeated attempts at organized insurrection were made; wholesale running
away, like that which established the exiles in Florida, was resorted
to; and a class of black landholders and voters arose. Such social
movements brought the colonists face to face with new and serious
problems; which they sought at first to settle in curious ways, denying
the rite of baptism, establishing the legal presumption that all Negroes
and mulattoes were slaves, and finally changing the Slave Code into a
Black Code, replacing a caste of condition by a caste of race, harshly
stopping legal sexual intercourse, and seeking to prevent further
complications by restricting and even suppressing the slave-trade.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">5</span>This concerted and determined action
again changed the character of the Negro problems, but they did not
cease to be grave. The inability of the Negro to escape from a servile
caste into political freedom turned the problems of the group into
problems of family life. On the separated plantations and in households
the Negro became a constituent member of the family, speaking its
language, worshiping in its churches, sharing its traditions, bearing
its name, and sometimes sharing its blood; the talented slaves found
large freedom in the intimate intercourse with the family which they
enjoyed; they lost many traditions of their fatherland, and their ideals
blended with the ideals of their new country. Some men began to see in
this development a physical, economic and moral danger to the land, and
they busied themselves with questions as to how they might provide for
the development of white and black without demoralizing the one or
amalgamating with the other. The solution of these difficulties was
sought in a widespread attempt to eliminate the Negro from the family as
he had formerly been eliminated from the state, by a process of
emancipation that made him and his sons not even half-free, with the
indefinite notion of colonizing the anomalous serfs thus created. This
policy was carried out until one-half the land and one-sixth of the
Negroes were quasi-freemen.</p>
<p>Just as the nation was on the point of realizing the futility of
colonization, one of those strange incalculable world movements began to
be felt throughout civilized states—a movement so vast that we call it
the economic revolution of the nineteenth century. A world demand for
crops peculiarly suited to the South, substituted in Europe the factory
system for the house industry, and in America the large plantation slave
system for the family patriarchy; slavery became an industrial system
and not a training school for serfdom; the Black Codes underwent a
sudden transformation which hardened the lot of the slave, <span
class="pagenum">6</span>facilitated the slave trade, hindered further
emancipation and rendered the condition of the free Negro unbearable.
The question of race and color in America assumed a new and peculiar
importance when it thus lay at the basis of some of the world’s greatest
industries.</p>
<p>The change in industrial conditions, however, not only affected the
demands of a world market, but so increased the efficiency of labor,
that a labor system, which in 1750 was eminently successful, soon became
under the altered conditions of 1850 not only an economic monstrosity,
but a political menace, and so rapidly did the crisis develop that the
whole evolution of the nation came to a standstill, and the settlement
of our social problems had to be left to the clumsy method of brute
force.</p>
<p>So far as the Negro race is concerned, the Civil War simply left us
face to face with the same sort of problems of social condition and
caste which were beginning to face the nation a century ago. It is these
problems that we are to-day somewhat helplessly—not to say
carelessly—facing, forgetful that they are living, growing social
questions whose progeny will survive to curse the nation, unless we
grapple with them manfully and intelligently.</p>
<h2 id="the-present-negro-problems">2. The Present Negro Problems</h2>
<p>Such are some of the changes of condition and social movement which
have, since 1619, altered and broadened the social problems grouped
about the American Negro. In this development of successive questions
about one centre, there is nothing peculiar to American history. Given
any fixed condition or fact—a river Nile, a range of Alps, an alien
race, or a national idea—and problems of society will at every stage of
advance group themselves about it. All social growth means a succession
of social problems—they constitute growth, they denote that laborious
and often baffling adjustment of action and condition which is the
essence of progress, and while a particular <span
class="pagenum">7</span>fact or circumstance may serve in one country as
a rallying point of many intricate questions of adjustment, the absence
of that particular fact would not mean the absence of all social
problems. Questions of labor, caste, ignorance and race were bound to
arise in America; they were simply complicated here and intensified
there by the presence of the Negro.</p>
<p>Turning now from this brief summary of the varied phases of these
questions, let us inquire somewhat more carefully into the form under
which the Negro problems present themselves to-day after 275 years of
evolution. Their existence is plainly manifested by the fact that a
definitely segregated mass of eight millions of Americans do not wholly
share the national life of the people; are not an integral part of the
social body. The points at which they fail to be incorporated into this
group life constitute the particular Negro problems, which can be
divided into two distinct but correlated parts, depending on two
facts:</p>
<p>First—Negroes do not share the full national life because as a mass
they have not reached a sufficiently high grade of culture.</p>
<p>Secondly—They do not share the full national life because there has
always existed in America a conviction—varying in intensity, but always
widespread—that people of Negro blood should not be admitted into the
group life of the nation no matter what their condition might be.</p>
<p>Considering the problems arising from the backward development of
Negroes, we may say that the mass of this race does not reach the social
standards of the nation with respect to</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Economic condition.</li>
<li>Mental training.</li>
<li>Social efficiency.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even if special legislation and organized relief intervene, freedmen
always start life under an economic disadvantage which generations,
perhaps centuries, cannot overcome. <span class="pagenum">8</span>Again,
of all the important constituent parts of our nation, the Negro is by
far the most ignorant; nearly half of the race are absolutely
illiterate, only a minority of the other half have thorough common
school training, and but a remnant are liberally educated. The great
deficiency of the Negro, however, is his small knowledge of the art of
organized social life —that last expression of human culture. His
development in group life was abruptly broken off by the slave ship,
directed into abnormal channels and dwarfed by the Black Codes, and
suddenly wrenched anew by the Emancipation Proclamation. He finds
himself, therefore, peculiarly weak in that nice adaptation of
individual life to the life of the group which is the essence of
civilization. This is shown in the grosser forms of sexual immorality,
disease and crime, and also in the difficulty of race organization for
common ends in economic or in intellectual lines.</p>
<p>For these reasons the Negro would fall behind any average modern
nation, and he is unusually handicapped in the midst of a nation which
excels in its extraordinary economic development, its average of popular
intelligence and in the boldness of its experiments in organized social
life.</p>
<p>These problems of poverty, ignorance and social degradation differ
from similar problems the world over in one important particular, and
that is the fact that they are complicated by a peculiar environment.
This constitutes the second class of Negro problems, and they rest, as
has been said, on the widespread conviction among Americans that no
persons of Negro descent should become constituent members of the social
body. This feeling gives rise to economic problems, to educational
problems, and nice questions of social morality; it makes it more
difficult for black men to earn a living or spend their earnings as they
will; it gives them poorer school facilities and restricted contact with
cultured classes; and it becomes, throughout the land, a cause and
excuse for discontent, lawlessness, laziness and injustice.</p>
<p>9</p>
<h2 id="the-necessity-of-carefully-studying-these-problems">3. <span
class="pagenum">9</span>The Necessity of Carefully Studying these
Problems</h2>
<p>Such, barely stated, are the elements of the present Negro problems.
It is to little purpose however to name the elements of a problem unless
we can also say accurately to what extent each element enters into the
final result: whether, for instance, the present difficulties arise more
largely from ignorance than from prejudice, or <em>vice versa</em>. This
we do not know, and here it is that every intelligent j discussion of
the American Negro comes to a standstill. I Nearly a hundred years ago
Thomas Jefferson complained that the nation had never studied the real
condition of the slaves and that, therefore, all general conclusions
about them were extremely hazardous. We of another age can scarcely say
that we have made material progress in this study. Yet these problems,
so vast and intricate, demanding trained research and expert analysis,
touching questions that affect the very foundation of the republic and
of human progress, increasing and multiplying year by year, would seem
to urge the nation with increasing force to measure and trace and
understand thoroughly the underlying elements of this example of human
evolution.</p>
<p>Now first we should study the Negro problems in order to distinguish
between the different and distinct problems affecting this race. Nothing
makes intelligent discussion of the Negro’s position so fruitless as the
repeated failure to discriminate between the different questions that
concern him. If a Negro discusses the question, he is apt to discuss
simply the problem of race prejudice; if a Southern white man writes on
the subject he is apt to discuss problems of ignorance, crime and social
degradation; and yet each calls the problem he discusses ihe Negro
problem, leaving in the dark background the really crucial question as
to the relative importance of the many problems involved. Before we can
begin to study the Negro intelligently, we <span
class="pagenum">10</span> must realize definitely that not only is he
affected by all the varying social forces that act on any nation at his
stage of advancement, but that in addition to these there is reacting
upon him the mighty power of a peculiar and unusual social environment
which affects to some extent every other social force.</p>
<p>In the second place we should seek to know and measure carefully all
the forces and conditions that go to make up these different problems,
to trace the historical development of these conditions, and discover as
far as possible the probable trend of further development. Without doubt
this would be difficult work, and it can with much truth be objected
that we cannot ascertain, by the methods of sociological research known
to us, all such facts thoroughly and accurately. To this objection it is
only necessary to answer that however difficult it may be to know all
about the Negro, it is certain that we can know vastly more than we do,
and that we can have our knowledge in more systematic and intelligible
form. As things are, our opinions upon the Negro are more matters of
faith than of knowledge. Every schoolboy is ready to discuss the matter,
and there are few men that have not settled convictions. Such a
situation is dangerous. Whenever any nation allows impulse, whim or
hasty conjecture to usurp the place of conscious, normative, intelligent
action, it is in grave danger. The sole aim of any society is to settle
its problems in accordance with its highest ideals, and the only
rational method of accomplishing this is to study those problems in the
light of the best scientific research.</p>
<p>Finally, the American Negro deserves study for the great end of
advancing the cause of science in general. No such opportunity to watch
and measure the history and development of a great race of men ever
presented itself to the scholars of a modern nation. If they miss this
opportunity—if they do the work in a slip-shod, unsystematic manner—if
they dally with the truth to humor the whims of the day, <span
class="pagenum">11</span> they do far more than hurt the good name of
the American people; they hurt the cause of scientific truth the world
over, they voluntarily decrease human knowledge of a universe of which
we are ignorant enough, and they degrade the high end of truth-seeking
in a day when they need more and more to dwell upon its sanctity.</p>
<h2 id="the-work-already-accomplished">4. The Work Already
Accomplished</h2>
<p>It may be said that it is not altogether correct to assert that few
attempts have been made to study these problems or to put the nation in
possession of a body of truth in accordance with which it might act
intelligently. It is far from my purpose to disparage in any way the
work already done by students of these questions; much valuable effort
has without doubt been put upon the field, and yet a careful survey of
the field seems but to emphasize the fact that the work done bears but
small proportion to the work still to be done.[^A bibliography of the
American Negro is a much needed undertaking. The existing literature may
be summarized briefly as follows: In the line of historical research
there are such general studies of the Negro as Williams’ “History of the
Negro Race in America,” Wilson’s, Goodell’s, Blake’s, Copley’s,
Greeley’s and Cobb’s studies of slavery, and the treatment of the
subject in the general histories of Bancroft, Von Holst and others. We
have, too, brief special histories of the institution of slavery in
Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, the
District of Columbia, Maryland and North Carolina. The slave trade has
been studied by Clarkson, Buxton, Benezet, Carey and others; Miss
McDougall has written a monograph on fugitive slaves; the Slave Codes
have been digested by Hurd, Stroud, Wheeler, Goodell and Cobb; the
economic aspects of the slave system were brilliantly outlined by
Cairnes, and a great amount of material is available, showing the
development of anti-slavery opinion. Of statistical and sociological
material the United States Government has collected much in its census
and bureau reports; and congressional investigations, and state
governments and societies have added something to this. Moreover, we
have the statistical studies of DeBow, Helper, Gannett and Hoffman, the
observations of Olmsted and Kemble, and the studies and interpretations
by Chambers, Otken, Bruce, Cable, Fortune, Brackett, Ingle and Tourgee;
foreign students, from De Tocqueville and Martineau to Halle and Bryce,
have studied the subject; something has been done in collecting folklore
and music, and in studying dialect, and some anthropological material
has been collected. Beside this, there is a mass of periodical
literature, of all degrees of value, teeming with opinions,
observations, personal experiences and discussions.]</p>
<p>Moreover the studies made hitherto can as a whole be justly
criticised in three particulars: (1) They have not <span
class="pagenum">12</span> been based on a thorough knowledge of details;
(2) they have been unsystematical; (3) they have been uncritical.</p>
<p>In few subjects have historians been more content to go on
indefinitely repeating current traditions and uninvestigated facts. We
are still gravely told that the slave trade ceased in 1808, that the
docility of Africans made slave insurrections almost unknown, and that
the Negro never developed in this country a self-conscious group life
before 1860. In the hasty endeavor to cover a broad subject when the
details were unknown, much superficial work has been current, like that,
for instance, of a newspaper reporter who spent “the odd intervals of
leisure in active newspaper work” for “nearly eighteen months,” in the
District of Columbia, and forthwith published a study of 80,000 Negroes,
with observations on their institutions and development.</p>
<p>Again, the work done has been lamentably unsystematic and
fragmentary. Scientific work must be subdivided, but conclusions which
affect the whole subject must be based on a study of the whole. One
cannot study the Negro in freedom and come to general conclusions about
his destiny without knowing his history in slavery. A vast set of
problems having a common centre must, too, be studied according to some
general plan, if the work of different students is to be compared or to
go toward building a unified body of knowledge. A plan once begun must
be carried out, and not like that of our erratic census reports, after
allowing us to follow the size of farms in the South for three decades,
suddenly leave us wondering as to the relation of farms and farm
families. Students of black codes should not stop suddenly with 1863,
and travelers and observers whose testimony would be of great value if
arranged with some system and reasonably limited in time and space, must
not ramble on without definite plan or purpose and render their whole
work of doubtful value.</p>
<p>Most unfortunate of all, however, is the fact that so much of the
work done on the Negro question is notoriously <span
class="pagenum">13</span> uncritical; uncritical from lack of
discrimination in the selection and weighing of evidence; uncritical in
choosing the proper point of view from which to study these problems,
and, finally, uncritical from the distinct bias in the minds of so many
writers. To illustrate, the layman who does not pretend to first hand
knowledge of the subject and who would learn of students is to-day
woefully puzzled by absolutely contradictory evidence. One student
declares that Negroes are advancing in knowledge and ability; that they
are working, establishing homes, and going into business, and that the
problem will soon be one of the past Another student of equal learning
declares that the Negro is degenerating—sinking into crime and social
immorality, receiving little help from education, still in the main a
menial servant, and destined in a short time to settle the problem by
dying entirely out. Such and many other contradictory conclusions arise
from the uncritical use of material. A visitor to a great Negro school
in the South catches the inspiration of youth, studies the work of
graduates, and imbibes the hopes of teachers and immediately infers from
the situation of a few hundred the general condition of a population
numbering twice that of Holland. A college graduate sees the slums of a
Southern city, looks at the plantation field hands, and has some
experience with Negro servants, and from the laziness, crime and disease
which he finds, draws conclusions as to eight millions of people,
stretched from Maine to Texas and from Florida to Washington. We
continually judge the whole from the part we are familiar with; we
continually assume the material we have at hand to be typical; we
reverently receive a column of figures without asking who collected
them, how they were arranged, how far they are valid and what chances of
error they contain; we receive the testimony of men without asking
whether they were trained or ignorant, careful or careless, truthful or
given to exaggeration, and, above all, whether they are giving facts or
opinions. It is so easy for a <span class="pagenum">14</span> man who
has already formed his conclusions to receive any and all testimony in
their favor without carefully weighing and testing it, that we sometimes
find in serious scientific studies very curious proof of broad
conclusions. To cite an extreme case, in a recently published study of
the Negro, a part of the argument as to the physical condition of all
these millions, is made to rest on the measurement of fifteen black boys
in a New York reformatory.</p>
<p>The widespread habit of studying the Negro from one point of view
only, that of his influence on the white inhabitants, is also
responsible for much uncritical work. The slaves are generally treated
as one inert changeless mass, and most studies of slavery apparently
have no conception of a social evolution and development among them. The
slave code of a state is given, the progress of anti-slavery sentiment,
the economic results of the system and the general influence of man on
master are studied, but of the slave himself, of his group life and
social institutions, of remaining traces of his African tribal life, of
his amusements, his conversion to Christianity, his acquiring of the
English tongue—in fine, of his whole reaction against his environment,
of all this we hear little or nothing, and would apparently be expected
to believe that the Negro arose from the dead in 1863. Yet all the
testimony of law and custom, of tradition and present social condition,
shows us that the Negro at the time of emancipation had passed through a
social evolution which far separated him from his savage ancestors.</p>
<p>The most baneful cause of uncritical study of the Negro is the
manifest and far-reaching bias of writers. Americans, are born in many
cases with deep, fierce convictions on the Negro question, and in other
cases imbibe them from their environment. When such men come to write on
the subject, without technical training, without breadth of view, and in
some cases without a deep sense of the sanctity of scientific truth,
their testimony, however interesting <span class="pagenum">15</span> as
opinion, must of necessity be worthless as science. Thus too often the
testimony of Negroes and their friends has to be thrown out of court on
account of the manifest prejudice of the writers; on the other hand, the
testimony of many other writers in the North and especially in the South
has to be received with reserve on account of too evident bias.</p>
<p>Such facts make the path of students and foreign observers peculiarly
thorny. The foreigner’s views, if he be not exceptionally astute, will
depend largely on his letters of introduction; the home student’s views,
on his birthplace and parentage. All students are apt to fail to
recognize the magnitude and importance of these problems, and to succumb
to the vulgar temptation of basing on any little contribution they make
to the study of these problems, general conclusions as to the origin and
destiny of the Negro people in time and eternity. Thus we possess
endless final judgments as the American Negro emanating from men of
influence and learning, in the very face of the fact known to every
accurate student, that there exists to-day no sufficient material of
proven reliability, upon which any scientist can base definite and final
conclusions as to the present condition and tendencies of the eight
million American Negroes; and that any person or publication purporting
to give such conclusions simply makes statements which go beyond the
reasonably proven evidence.</p>
<h2 id="a-program-of-future-study">5. A Program of Future Study</h2>
<p>If we admit the deep importance of the Negro problems, the necessity
of studying them, and certain shortcomings in work done up to this time,
it would seem to be the clear duty of the American people, in the
interests of scientific knowledge and social reform, to begin a broad
and systematic study of the history and condition of the American
Negroes. The scope and method of this study, however, needs to be
generally agreed upon beforehand in its main <span
class="pagenum">16</span> outlines, not to hinder the freedom of
individual students, but to systematize and unify effort so as to cover
the wide field of investigation.</p>
<p>The scope of any social study is first of all limited by the general
attitude of public opinion toward truth and truth-seeking. If in regard
to any social problem there is for any reason a persistent refusal on
the part of the people to allow the truth to be known, then manifestly
that problem cannot be studied. Undoubtedly much of the unsatisfactory
work already done with regard to the Negro is due to this cause; the
intense feeling that preceded and followed the war made a calm balanced
research next to impossible. Even to-day there are certain phases of
this question which we cannot hope to be allowed to study
dispassionately and thoroughly, and these phases, too, are naturally
those uppermost in the public mind. For instance, it is extremely
doubtful if any satisfactory study of Negro crime and lynching can be
made for a generation or more, in the present condition of the public
mind, which renders it almost impossible to get at the facts and real
conditions. On the other hand, public opinion has in the last decade
become sufficiently liberal to open a broad field of investigation to
students, and here lies the chance for effective work.</p>
<p>The right to enter this field undisturbed and untrammeled will depend
largely on the attitude of science itself. Students must be careful to
insist that science as such—be it physics, chemistry, psychology, or
sociology—has but one simple aim: the discovery of truth. Its results
lie open for the use of all men—merchants, physicians, men of letters,
and philanthropists, but the aim of science itself is simple truth. Any
attempt to give it a double aim, to make social reform the immediate
instead of the mediate object of a search for truth, will inevitably
tend to defeat both objects. The frequent alliance of sociological
research with various panaceas and particular schemes of reform, has
<span class="pagenum">17</span> resulted in closely connecting social
investigation with a good deal of groundless assumption and humbug in
the popular mind. There will be at first some difficulty in bringing the
Southern people, both black and white, to conceive of an earnest,
careful study of the Negro problem which has not back of it some scheme
of race amalgamation, political jobbery, or deportation to Africa. The
new study of the American Negro must avoid such misapprehensions from
the outset, by insisting that historical and statistical research has
but one object, the ascertainment of the facts as to the social forces
and conditions of one-eighth of the inhabitants of the land. Only by
such rigid adherence to the true object of the scholar, can statesmen
and philanthropists of all shades of belief be put into possession of a
reliable body of truth which may guide their efforts to the best and
largest success.</p>
<p>In the next place, a study of the Negro, like the study of any
subject, must start out with certain generally admitted postulates. We
must admit, for instance, that the field of study is large and varying,
and that what is true of the Negro in Massachusetts is not necessarily
true of the Negro in Louisiana; that what was true of the Negro in 1850
was not necessarily true in 1750; and that there are many distinct
social problems affecting the Negro. Finally, if we would rally to this
common ground of scientific inquiry all partisans and advocates, we must
explicitly admit what all implicitly postulate—namely, that the Negro is
a member of the human race, and as one who, in the light of history and
experience, is capable to a degree of improvement and culture, is
entitled to have his interests considered according to his numbers in
all conclusions as to the common weak</p>
<p>With these preliminary considerations we may say that the study of
the Negro falls naturally into two categories, which though difficult to
separate in practice, must for the sake of logical clearness, be kept
distinct. They are (a) <span class="pagenum">18</span> the study of the
Negro as a social group, (£) the study of his peculiar social
environment.</p>
<p>The study of the Negro as a social group may be, for convenience,
divided into four not exactly logical but seemingly most practicable
divisions, viz:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Historical study,</li>
<li>Statistical investigation.</li>
<li>Anthropological measurement</li>
<li>Sociological interpretation.</li>
</ol>
<p>The material at hand for historical research is rich and abundant;
there are the colonial statutes and records, the partially accessible
archives of Great Britain, France and Spain, the collections of
historical societies, the vast number of executive and congressional
reports and documents, the state statutes, reports and publications, the
reports of institutions and societies, the personal narratives and
opinions of various observers and the periodical press covering nearly
three centuries. From these sources can be gathered much new information
upon the economic and social development of the Negro, upon the rise and
decline of the slave-trade, the character, distribution and state of
culture of the Africans, the evolution of the slave codes as expressing
the life of the South, the rise of such peculiar expressions of Negro
social history, as the Negro church, the economics of plantation life,
the possession of private property by slaves, and the history of the
oft-forgotten class of free Negroes. Such historical research must be
subdivided in space and limited in time by the nature of the subject,
the history of the different colonies and groups being followed and
compared, the different periods of development receiving special study,
and the whole subject being reviewed from different aspects.</p>
<p>The collection of statistics should be carried on with increased care
and thoroughness. It is no credit to a great modern nation that so much
well-grounded doubt can be thrown on our present knowledge of the simple
matters of <span class="pagenum">19</span> number, age, sex and conjugal
condition in regard to our Negro population. General statistical
investigations should avoid seeking to tabulate more intricate social
conditions than the ones indicated. The concrete social status of the
Negro can only be ascertained by intensive studies carried on in
definitely limited localities, by competent investigators, in accordance
with one general plan. Statistical study by groups is apt to be more
accurately done and more easily accomplished, and able to secure more
competent and responsible agents than any general census. General
averages in so complicated a subject are apt to be dangerously
misleading. This study should seek to ascertain by the most approved
methods of social measurement the size and condition of families, the
occupations and wages, the illiteracy of adults and education of
children, the standard of living, the character of the dwellings, the
property owned and rents paid, and the character of the organized group
life. Such investigations should be extended until they cover the
typical group life of Negroes in all sections of the land and should be
so repeated from time to time in the same localities and with the same
methods, as to be a measure of social development.</p>
<p>The third division of study is anthropological measurement, and it
includes a scientific study of the Negro body. The most obvious
peculiarity of the Negro—a peculiarity which is a large element in many
of the problems affecting him—is his physical unlikeness to the people
with whom he has been brought into contact. This difference is so
striking that it has become the basis of a mass of theory, assumption
and suggestion which is deep-rooted and yet rests on the flimsiest basis
of scientific fact. That there are differences between the white and
black races is certain, but just what those differences are is known to
none with an approach to accuracy. Yet here in America is the most
remarkable opportunity ever offered of studying these differences, of
noting influences of climate and physical environment, and <span
class="pagenum">20</span> particularly of studying the effect of
amalgamating two of the most diverse races in the world—another subject
which rests under a cloud of ignorance.</p>
<p>The fourth division of this investigation is sociological
interpretation; it should include the arrangement and interpretation of
historical and statistical matter in the light of the experience of
other nations and other ages; it should aim to study those finer
manifestations of social life which history can but mention and which
statistics can not count, such as the expression of Negro life as found
in their hundred newspapers, their considerable literature, their music
and folklore and their germ of esthetic life—in fine, in all the
movements and customs among them that manifest the existence of a
distinct social mind.</p>
<p>The second category of studies of the Negro has to do with his
peculiar social environment. It will be difficult, as has been
intimated, to separate a study of the group from a study of the
environment, and yet the group action and the reaction of the
surroundings must be kept clearly distinct if we expect to comprehend
the Negro problems. The study of the environment may be carried on at
the same time with a study of the group, only the two sets of forces
must receive distinct measurement.</p>
<p>In such a field of inquiry it will be found difficult to do more than
subdivide inquiry in time and space. The attempt should be made to
isolate and study the tangible phenomena of Negro prejudice in all
possible cases; its effect on the Negro’s physical development, on his
mental acquisitiveness, on his moral and social condition, as manifested
in economic life, in legal sanctions and in crime and lawlessness. So,
too, the influence of that same prejudice on American life and character
would explain the otherwise inexplicable changes through which Negro
prejudice has passed.</p>
<p>The plan of study thus sketched is, without doubt, long, difficult
and costly, and yet is not more than commensurable <span
class="pagenum">21</span> with the size and importance of the subject
with which it is to deal. It will take years and decades to carry out
such a plan, with the barest measure of success, and yet there can be no
doubt but that this plan or something similar to it, points to the
quickest path toward the ultimate solution of the present
difficulties.</p>
<h2 id="the-proper-agents-for-this-work">6. The Proper Agents for this
Work</h2>
<p>In conclusion it will not be out of place to suggest the agencies
which seem best fitted to carry out a work of this magnitude There will,
without doubt, always be room for the individual working alone as he
wills; if, however, we wish to cover the field systematically, and in
reasonable time, only organized and concerted efforts will avail; and
the requisite means, skill and preparation for such work can be
furnished by two agencies alone: the government and the university.</p>
<p>For simple, definite inquiries carried out periodically on a broad
scale we should depend on the national and state governments. The
decennial census properly organized under civil service rules should be
the greatest single agency for collecting general information as to the
Negro. If, however, the present Congress cannot be induced to organize a
census bureau under proper Civil Service rules, and in accordance with
the best expert advice, we must continue for many years more to depend
on clumsy and ignorant methods of measurement in matters demanding
accuracy and trained technique. It is possible also for the different
national bureaus and for the state governments to study certain aspects
of the Negro question over wide areas. A conspicuous example of this is
the valuable educational statistics collected by Commissioner Harris,
and the series of economic studies just instituted by the Bureau of
Labor.</p>
<p>On the whole it may be laid down as axiomatic that government
activity in the study of this problem should confine <span
class="pagenum">22</span> itself mainly to the ascertainment of simple
facts covering a broad field. For the study of these social problems in
their more complicated aspects, where the desideratum is intensive
study, by trained minds, according to the best methods, the only
competent agency is the university. Indeed, in no better way could the
American university repay the unusual munificence of its benefactors
than by placing before the nation a body of scientific truth in the
light of which they could solve some of their most vexing social
problems.</p>
<p>It is to the credit of the University of Pennsylvania that she has
been the first to recognize her duty in this respect, and in so far as
restricted means and opportunity allowed, has attempted to study the
Negro problems in a single definite locality. This work needs to be
extended to other groups, and carried out with larger system; and here
it would seem is the opportunity of the Southern Negro college. We hear
much of higher Negro education, and yet all candid people know there
does not exist to-day in the centre of Negro population a single
first-class fully equipped institution devoted to the higher education
of Negroes; not more than three Negro institutions in the South deserve
the name of college at all; and yet what is a Negro college but a vast
college settlement for the study of a particular set of peculiarly
baffling problems ? What more effective or suitable agency could be
found in which to focus the scientific efforts of the great universities
of the North and East, than an institution situated in the very heart of
these social problems, and made the centre of careful historical and
statistical research? Without doubt the first effective step toward the
solving of the Negro question will be the endowment of a Negro college
which is not merely a teaching body, but a centre of sociological
research, in close connection and co-operation with Harvard, Columbia,
Johns Hopkins and the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>In this direction the Negro conferences of Tuskeegee and Hampton are
tending; and there is already inaugurated an <span
class="pagenum">23</span> actual beginning of work at Atlanta
University. In 1896 this university brought into correspondence about
one hundred Southern college-bred men and laid before them a plan of
systematic investigation into certain problems of Negro city life, as,
for instance, family conditions, dwellings, rents, ownership of homes,
occupations, earnings, disease and death-rates. Each investigator took
one or more small groups to study, and in this way fifty-nine groups,
aggregating 5000 people in various parts of the country, were studied,
and the results have been published by the United States Bureau of
Labor. Such purely scientific work, done with an eye single to
ascertaining true conditions, marks an era in our conception of the
place of the Negro college, and it is certainly to be desired that
Atlanta University may be enabled to continue this work as she proposes
to do.</p>
<p>Finally the necessity must again be emphasized of keeping clearly
before students the object of all science, amid the turmoil and intense
feeling that clouds the discussion of a burning social question. We live
in a day when in spite of the brilliant accomplishments of a remarkable
century, there is current much flippant criticism of scientific work;
when the truth-seeker is too often pictured as devoid of human sympathy,
and careless of human ideals. We are still prone in spite of all our
culture to sneer at the heroism of the laboratory while we cheer the
swagger of the street broil. At such a time true lovers of humanity can
only hold higher the pure ideals of science, and continue to insist that
if we would solve a problem we must study it, and that there is but one
coward on earth, and that is the coward that dare not know.</p>
