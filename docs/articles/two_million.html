<p><span class="pagenum">64</span> The thought realm in which the two
million Negro women in the United States, gainfully employed, live and
work, vibrates with pathos and humor, determination and true heroism,
belief and expectation that with the coming years, they too, as a group,
with training and larger opportunities, will come into their own as real
women.</p>
<p>The three types of occupations in which the majority of these women
are engaged are (1) domestic and personal service, (2) agriculture, (3)
manufacturing and mechanical industries.</p>
<p>To-day they are found in domestic service, nearly a million strong,
with all their shortcomings—their lack of training in efficiency, in
cleanliness of person, in honesty and truthfulness, and with all of the
shortcomings of ordinary domestic service; namely, basement living
quarters, poor working conditions, too long hours, no Sundays off, no
standards of efficiency, and the servant “brand.” In spite of migration
during the World War they are found on the farms, with all of the
inconveniences and health hazards of Southern plantation life, in larger
numbers than in domestic service. Before the World War there were over
67,000 of them in the unskilled processes of the manufacturing and
mechanical industries and 3000 in the semi-skilled processes. These
numbers were greatly increased during the war. In 152 plants visited in
1918-19, by Department of Labor representatives, more than 20,000 were
found employed.</p>
<h2 id="domestic-service">Domestic Service</h2>
<p>During the past twelve months some decided changes affecting Negro
women have taken place in domestic and personal service. For instance,
in Detroit, Michigan, to-day, from eighty to ninety per cent of the
calls for domestic workers are for white girls. The average wage in that
city for general houseworkers is from $ 8 to $12 a week as against $15
to $20 a year ago. Women working by the day receive from $.40 to $.50 an
hour as against $.60 to $.70 one year ago. The calls for office,
elevator, and stock girls are no longer for Negro girls.</p>
<p>In Washington, D. C., with the fixing of the minimum wage in the
hotels, restaurants, etc., at $16.50 for a forty-eight-hour week, and
the increasing number of available white women, Negro women were to a
very large extent displaced. Wages for <span class="pagenum">65</span>
domestic service for the rank and file have fallen in the past twelve
months from $10 a week without any laundry work to $7 and $8 with
laundry work. In the parlance of the women, “general housework” now
means “cook, wash, and ine (iron).” The numbers driven into domestic
work are very large. At one employment agency in this city there are
often as many as 200 Negro women a day applying for work. A large
majority of them are untrained, inefficient, and poorly equipped with
the one thing needful—a good reference.</p>

<p>Only two of the Washington laundries are to-day paying the minimum
wage. The average wage in the other laundries is $9 per week, and a few
workers get as little as $6. Ninety per cent of these laundry workers
are Negro women. As soon as some of the laundries began to fear that
they would be forced to pay the minimum wage they began to ask the
employment bureaus about the possibility of obtaining white girls. Now
that they are not paying the minimum wage they are perfectly satisfied
with Negro women. A few of these have been in the laundries from
fourteen to thirty-eight years, working through from the flat-work
department until they are now “finishing” shirt-bosoms—which one who
understands must term really artistic work. In Los Angeles, California,
Negro women cooks get from <span class="pagenum">66</span> $60 to $100
per month, chambermaids from $40 to $75, nurses from $50 to $75,
mothers’ helpers from $20 to $40. Day workers receive from $.45 to $.50
an hour. These women are, however, through the unions, excluded from
even the laundries.</p>
<p>Some very evident changes have come about in personal and domestic
service during the past twelve months, and yet there is much the same
restlessness and change from one employer to another; much the same wear
and tear on households and housewives; many of the same old customs and
conventions. The bond between mistress and maid in many cases is not
sufficiently strong for the mistress to learn her maid’s surname or her
address. Neither seems personally interested in the other and often
neither knows, even when they separate, just what the other has been
thinking. When one deeply interested in the whole problem analyzes the
conditions and sympathizes with mistress and maid sufficiently to get
the whole truth, she must conclude that in too many cases the feeling of
each borders on real dislike for the other. Neither has for the other
that priceless possession—confidence.</p>
<p>Recently a gentleman applied to an employment agency for a maid or,
more correctly speaking, a general houseworker. Upon being asked how
many there were in his family, he said, in a somewhat hesitating manner,
“Just two in the family, except two boys who don’t amount to much—one is
six years old and the other is eight.’’ No idea of taking advantage of
anyone entered his mind, for his were the thoughts of a man! but the
women domestics who heard him at once came to the conclusion that he was
trying to “slip something over.” On the other hand, a lady advertised
for a maid and fifteen came at different times during the day to see
her. She engaged every one of them to begin work the next morning and
not one of them “showed up.” When maids wish a holiday or Sunday off,
death in their families, falls by which they are seriously injured,
automobile accidents, faked special-delivery letters (especially when
they live with the employer’s family) annual meetings of lodges in
distant cities, and all sorts of other make-believe excuses are given.
The night they are paid off they often arrange everything for breakfast,
saying they will be back in the morning, but they never return. Often,
on the other hand, when a maid applies for a place, if she is not
suitable, she is told by the lady of the house that her former maid has
just come back.</p>

<p>Letters, cards, telephone calls, the people themselves, bespeak the
pathos, the restlessness, the ignorance, the inefficiency, the absolute
need of the standardization of domestic <span class="pagenum">67</span>
service as an occupation or industry, and also the absolute need of
domestic-training schools in connection with public employment
agencies.</p>
<h2 id="agriculture">Agriculture</h2>
<p>A woman owning over a thousand acres of land in the Black Belt of
Alabama wrote me, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Farm conditions are as bad as we have ever seen them. The cotton crop
is very poor. Women can pick on an average of from 85 to 110 pounds of
cotton per day, for which they get 40 cents a hundred. The peanut farms
also furnish some work for women at the rate of 50 cents a day. They
pull up the peanut bushes and let them dry. The bushes are then taken to
a steam peanut picker which picks off the peanuts; these are then sacked
and sent to the factory.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Down here women do almost any kind of work on the farm from handling
a two-horse plow, and hoeing and pulling fodder, to cleaning new ground.
Women in domestic service here get from $7 to $8 per month.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Allowing much for migration and giving due credit to the General
Education Board, the Slater and Rosenwald Funds, the Jeanes supervisors,
and the farm-demonstration agents, who are doing a great work in rural
districts of the South, there are many thousand Negro women on the farms
to-day eking out such a bare existence as is described in the above
letter. They are out early in the morning afoot and on horseback going
to near-by fields and, in many instances, on wagons going to fields four
and five miles distant. If the fields are near by, they hurry home in
the heat of the broiling sun to cook their families’ <span
class="pagenum">68</span> dinners, often over a blazing fire on the
hearth, and after dinner they return to the fields in what seems to city
people sweltering heat. They tarry late in the fields because, as they
say, they can work better “in the cool of the evenin’.”</p>
<p>In many sections almost the only recreational or social contacts
enjoyed by such women come through the monthly church meeting, the
occasional burial of a friend, or the annual trip to town at cotton-seed
time. Better prepared ministers, more missionary school-teachers and
welfare workers, and many district nurses would make the life of the
average agricultural woman worker more endurable.</p>

<p>Many well-informed persons are apt to think that there were no Negro
women in manufacturing or mechanical industries until the World War. On
the contrary there were and are still some thousands of Negro women in
the cigar and tobacco factories of the country. They are poorly paid, of
course, their wages ranging from $6 to $10 for a sixty-hour week. The
work is dirty, and most of the factories are poorly ventilated, being
without an air shaft for the expulsion of the dust; the result is that
the tobacco fumes and dust almost suffocate new workers. Then, the work
being more or less seasonal, women are sometimes out of employment for
weeks at a time. In most tobacco factories the only seats for the women
are boxes or stools without backs; and in a few factories women stemming
<span class="pagenum">69</span> tobacco sit flat on the floor, humming a
tune while they work. Even fairly respectable lunch rooms and decent
toilet facilities are lacking.</p>

<p>Before the World War unskilled Negro women workers in small numbers
were in the clothing, food, and metal industries. They were to be found
especially in slaughtering and meatpacking houses, crab and peanut
factories, and iron, steel and automobile industries. They were also
working in furniture and shoe factories, printing and publishing
establishments, and in cotton and silk mills. There were semi-skilled
workers in electrical-supply, paper-box, and rubber factories, and in
the textile industries. Finally there were a few skilled tailoresses,
tinsmiths, coppersmiths, and upholsterers. The story of their entrance
into industry in large numbers during the World War is too familiar to
warrant repetition here. The <span class="pagenum">70</span> part they
played in winning the war will probably not be told for many years to
come.</p>
<p>Just before the beginning of the unemployment crisis the Women’s
Bureau of the Department of Labor made a survey of Negro women employed
in 150 plants in 17 localities of 9 States. In those plants, covering
food, furniture, glass, leather, metal, and paper products, tobacco, and
textiles, there were 11,812 Negro women employed. Some of these were
even making and decorating lamp-shades; some were making cores in
foundries; and others were competing successfully (according to their
employers) with girls of many years’ experience in the textile
industries. Still others were serving as stenographers, typists, etc.,
in two large mail-order houses in the Middle West.</p>

</figure>
<p>The questions in the minds of us all are these: How many of these
industries still employ Negro women in appreciable number in the skilled
and unskilled processes? Are there many Negro women in other industries?
And how will Negro women bread-winners, unused to domestic service,
weather the storm of the unemployment depression? Information to date
from industrial plants in the East, West, North, and South indicates
that a large number of Negro women have lost their places within the
last twelve months. One large garment factory in the Middle West, one of
the first to take on Negro women and <span class="pagenum">71</span> one
that seemed proud of its experiment, says now, “We have discontinued the
use of Negro women.” A Southern mill that used some Negro women before
the war says, “We use Negro women only occasionally now for odd
jobs.”</p>

</figure>
<p>In spite of such reports, at least some Negro women are still
employed in factories. For instance, the Virginia and Maryland crab
factories employ 5000 to 8000 of these women. Some of them, now forty or
fifty years of age, have been in the same factory since they were twelve
years old. Crabs are brought in barrels placed in large, iron,
crate-like kettles, which are set down into steam for the purpose of
cooking the crabs. A newer method is to use cars with seven barrels of
<span class="pagenum">72</span> crabs to a car. The cars are run on
tracks into a steam chest which cooks the crabs in a few minutes. When
they are cold each woman receives a certain number of shovelfuls at a
long wooden table, or, in a more up-to-date factory, at a better
arranged table for two workers. The woman sits on a box, or a “backless”
stool, strikes a crab one blow with the handle of a small knife with
curved blade, taking off a part of the shell, and, often without even
looking at the crab, cuts out what is called “the dead man” and then the
white meat, which falls into a pan, and the dark meat, which falls into
another. The work is done so rapidly that women pick from forty to
seventy-five pounds a day, thus earning $3 or more a day. The crab
factories are built over the water, many of them having cement floors. A
woman who has worked in such a factory for many years, upon being asked
about the healthfulness of such an arrangement, said, “Yes, ma’am, the
floors gen’ally fills you full o’ rheumatism. Some mo’nin’s I kin hardly
git out o’bed, I’se so stiff and painful.” In spite of the lack of any
arrangement that might be called sanitary, except in a very few
factories, one never saw a happier group of workers anywhere than the
Negro women in the crab factories.</p>
<p>Women who have never worked out and whose husbands have lost their
jobs after ten or twenty years’ service on the railroads or in other
places, and others who have worked out but have not been inside of an
employment agency for twenty-five or more years, are now trying, through
such agencies or through friends, to find a day’s work—cleaning or
washing or sewing; hair-dressing or manicuring; acting as agents for
selling goods; assisting undertakers; or doing anything else whereby
they can earn a living. Struggling against lack of training and against
inefficiency, restricted in opportunities to get and hold jobs, more
than two million Negro women and girls are to-day laboring in domestic
service, in agriculture, and in manufacturing pursuits with the hope of
an economic independence that will some day enable them to take their
places in the ranks with other working women.</p>
