<p><span class="pagenum">137</span> Much has been said and written upon
the crime of Negroes, and especially the Negroes of the North. It is
important therefore that a careful and somewhat detailed Study of this
subject be made. To introduce the subject properly, it is necessary
first to consider a few fundamental questions of criminal sociology. The
same principles which affect crime in general must affect crime when
committed by Negroes. Therefore we shall attempt to answer briefly the
following questions: What is crime? How can crime be measured? What is
the basis of a statistical measurement of crime? What is the social
meaning of crime: its effect ? What are its causes? Are they individual
or personal? Are they social and economic? No attempt is made here to
discuss anything except the fundamental principles.</p>
<p>What is crime? A crime is an infraction of any legal enactment whose
purpose is to preserve the peace, common order and decency, as
interpreted by the social group. There is no uniformity as to what acts
constitute crimes in all countries or parts of the same country. It is a
crime in Georgia punishable by heavy fine and imprisonment for Negroes
and whites to marry, but it is no crime in Pennsylvania or New York. It
is a crime in Pennsylvania to employ a child under fourteen years, but
it is not in Mississippi. In a highly developed community there are more
possible crimes than in a less developed or primitive community. In
Palestine, in the days of Jesus, men might go through the fields and
pluck corn, and eat at will, but in New York, for taking a single ear of
corn, one is liable to sentence. Many laws are necessary in complex
communities which would be superfluous in a simple country community. In
such a community few persons are interferred with in constructing their
houses, while in cities like Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago, and New
York, many details of construction are laid down by law. Street
regulations, sanitary regulations, regulations regarding bicycles,
automobiles, saloons, gambling, prostitution, trade, dance-halls, etc.,
abound in the complex community <span class="pagenum">138</span> which
are almost unknown in simpler environments. It is therefore clear that a
person living in rural districts may commit many of the same acts
without offense, which, if committed in a city, would be criminal. The
chances therefore of a person becoming a criminal are often increased by
the mere change from country to city, without any change whatever in his
moral character.</p>
<p>Further, as it is apparent that what constitutes a crime is not a
uniformity, it is also true that crime, or the mere number of crimes
committed does not represent, with any accuracy, the moral status of a
people. For, in a complex community, it is harder to escape crime than
in a simple community. If the man in his simple environment commits one
crime, while the man of the complex environment, with four or five times
as many possible crimes as the other man, commits four crimes, it is not
a proper measure of the criminality of each, to say that the latter is
four times as criminal as the former.</p>
<p>In judging criminality, the environment as to complexity and
simplicity must be taken into consideration: the criminality of one
community, other things being equal, being to the criminality of
another, about as the proportion between the possible crimes and actual
crimes in the respective communities.</p>
<h2 id="statistics-of-crime">Statistics of Crime</h2>
<p>How we shall measure crime is a most baffling question. In popular
writings the number of arrests is frequently assured to be a proper
indication of crime and writers often base sweeping generalizations upon
such figures. Arrests, however, do not give an accurate picture of
crime, and especially for purposes of comparison. In the first place we
have to consider that annually hundreds of persons are arrested who have
not committed any crime whatever. For example, according to the
Statistics of the Pennsylvania Board of Public Charities, although
hundreds of thousands were arrested in that State in 1907, only 29,005
persons appeared before grand juries, only 22,230 persons were tried, of
these 1,730 were discharged without even coming to trial, while 9,308
were acquitted, showing clearly, that a large percentage of those
arrested were not criminals at all.</p>
<p>Not only are thousands arrested who have never committed any crime,
but also thousands are not arrested, who probably have committed crimes,
often serious crimes. If they are not arrested, they cannot be counted
and cannot therefore figure in the statistics of crime. The strength and
efficiency of the police force, the general attitude of the
administrative powers, and the state of public opinion in the respective
periods of time, or cities, or districts must be considered and
compared.</p>
<p>A better method of comparison is between convictions; and yet this is
not accurate. For as a large number of criminals are never arrested,
they cannot be convicted; also some guilty persons who <span
class="pagenum">139</span> are arrested escape conviction. But with this
admitted inaccuracy in this method of measurement—by convictions—it is
yet true that, as far as we have been able to test criminality by police
statistics, convictions are the best measure we have as to the amount of
crime.</p>
<p>We may compare the amount of crime by comparing the complexity of the
environment, the density of population, the complexity and
comprehensiveness of the criminal code, the strength and efficiency of
the police force, with the number of arrests and convictions in the
respective localities, or periods. Even here we would be apt to make a
grievous error.</p>
<p>It is conceivable that one place may be much more criminal than
another, though the latter has proportionately more convictions. In the
first place, each arrest and conviction lessens the criminality. For
example, when Philadelphia’s “Tenderloin” was “wide open,” it was
conceded that there was much crime: liquor was sold freely on Sunday,
and without license, bawdy houses flourished and prostitutes openly
plied their trade in the streets before the very eyes of the policeman;
pickpockets, sneak thieves, hold-up men, petty gamblers were practically
undisturbed; and policy shops did a large business among the ignorant
poor. There were fewer arrests and fewer convictions than at a following
time when the laws were more vigorously enforced. Indeed there may have
been more, rather than less crime. When the city suppressed this crime,
and, in the popular phrase, “cleaned up” these districts, the criminal
character of the community decreased, but the arrests and convictions,
for a while at least, increased. The real change was in the enforcing of
law against crime, and not in the increase of crime; crime was really on
the decrease. Only therefore, when there is uniformity of
administration, judicial and executive, both as to arrests and
convictions, can these above factors be taken as guides of comparison
with any degree of accuracy. This we have not yet attained, and are far
from it.</p>
<h2 id="analysis-of-offenses">Analysis of Offenses</h2>
<p>Even if there is uniform enforcement, mere numbers would not mean
very much. An analysis of the offenses must be made. For general
conveniences the division into petty offenses or misdemeanors, and gross
offenses or felonies is frequently used. It may be that a dozen petty
offenses may not be as far-reaching in the social harm done, as one
gross offence. For example, if forty men are taken in a crap game and
sentenced to five days in the county prison, there are forty arrests and
forty convictions; but the amount of criminality represented is
comparatively small. Crap shooting is not a very great crime; it does
not affect many more people, than those engaged in it; few fortunes are
lost at it; comparatively few families suffer because of it, and society
is but little affected. On the other hand, a bank official or political
boss may misuse the funds of his institution, or government, and be
arrested and convicted. He counts <span class="pagenum">140</span> for
only one. Mere statistics of arrest and convictions in comparison, would
be misleading; for this last criminal may have operated systematically
for years, ruining many people; debauching society as well as corrupting
finance, causing public confidence to decrease with harm to himself, his
own family and many other families. The social injury done by the forty
crap-shooters is not to be compared with that of the bank defalcator,
except in statistics.</p>
<p>Not only must an analysis and classification of the crimes be made
but a study of the social situation, and the physical make-up of the
so-called criminals. First, we must take into account the sex of the
criminals, so as to see what differences there are in tendencies;
secondly, occupations, to find what crimes seem to be associated with
the occupations of persons; or in what occupations most crimes are
committed; then a study of the ages of criminals; and also a study of
general social environments, education, religious training, home life,
family life, morals, etc. . The physical condition, as determined by
under-feeding, clothing, abnormalities and a dozen other factors, enter
and must be disposed of before we are able to handle intelligently the
question of the causes of crime in a particular group.</p>
<h2 id="difficulties-of-comparing-groups">Difficulties of Comparing
Groups</h2>
<p>It is difficult to estimate the criminality of a given community, and
far more difficult to compare the criminality of different groups, for
example that of cities; or of minor groups included in the same larger
group, for example the nationalities or races of a great city or state;
in order to find the comparative criminal tendencies of the several
groups. For in the case of cities, or states, or nations, there are
different standards of crime determined by laws, customs, efficiency of
policemen; politics entering into the question of arrests and conviction
in varying degrees, etc. Professor H.T. Kealing, in his paper on “Crime
among Negroes,” has pointed out some of the difficulties in comparing
different groups.</p>
<h2 id="crime-among-negroes">Crime Among Negroes</h2>
<p>When it comes to a comparison of crime among Negroes with the larger
community, there are even greater difficulties. Historically, Negroes
have had to prove their innocence and not their prosecutors prove their
guilt. Under the laws of slavery, T.R.R. Cobb, an eminent Southern
jurist, wrote in The Law of Negro Slavery: “Reasons of policy and
necessity, require that so long as two races of men live together, the
one as master and the other as dependents and slaves, to a certain
extent all of the superior race shall exercise a controlling power over
the inferior, … Hence have arisen in the states, the various police and
patrol regulations, giving to white persons, other than the master,
under certain circumstances, the right of controlling, and in some
cases, correcting slaves.”Thus in most of the Southern states, the
police system was primarily and often only <span
class="pagenum">141</span> for Negroes and not for whites. Another
historical factor relates to the crimes for which Negroes may be
arrested. Historically, any word of protest against a white man by a
Negro was insolence or disorderly conduct; and it was a serious crime
for a Negro to strike or “presume to strike a white person” (as the New
Jersey law puts it) in the South, and in some Northern states; but a
white man was simply exercising his right as a member of the “superior”
caste in abusing the Negro, and could strike him with impunity, only
some laws prohibited maiming and killing. A box of the ears was no crime
when given by a white to a black, but the reverse was punishable by
flogging. This was true by law or custom in every Southern state, and by
law in many Northern states, such as New Jersey by a law of 1713, New
York by an act of 1706, Massachusetts by an act of 1707, and in
Connecticut by acts of 1708 and 1730.</p>
<p>A further and most important historical factor is that of the
credibility of the witness. By law in most Southern states and some
Northern states, a Negro could not testify against a white man even for
himself; as for example, in the States of New York, Ohio, New Jersey,
Connecticut, Illinois, and Indiana, in some cases a dozen Negroes to the
contrary, would not, according to the law, be strong enough to outweigh
the testimony of two whites. Furthermore, no Negro was permitted to
serve on a jury, not only in the Southern states, but in many states of
the North.</p>
<p>It cannot be doubted that these historical factors have a very
decided influence in the cases of Negroes in our courts to-day, even in
the North. ## Poverty as a Factor in Crime</p>
<p>The crimes of the poor are generally their vices, which affect them
more than they affect the other part of the community. The vices of the
well-to-do, on the other hand, are seldom called criminal, unless they
become of great social concern. A fashionable set may give euchre or
bridge parties and hundreds of dollars may change hands and women may
earn their “pin money” thereby, but they are rarely ever disturbed. The
fashionable gentleman who gets drunk at a fashionable club, or the
student on a “lark,” is sent home in a carriage, undisturbed; often the
shoplifter of wealth and good family is merely a “kleptomaniac.” These
facts should be considered when it is remembered that “craps” and
“drunks” and “disorderlies” are chief causes for the large number of
arrests and convictions among the poor. Negroes of the great Northern
cities, being largely among the poor, must be affected by the
differences which poverty makes in these matters.</p>
<p>Then there is the matter of the trial after arrests. Even before
justice, poverty suffers. On this point, <em>The Independent</em> of
February 1, 1905, under the title of “The Law’s Delays,” said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <em>Tribune of Chicago</em> remarks that the fact that one-fourth
the male convicts <span class="pagenum">142</span> at Joliet (a state
penitentiary) and one-half of the female convicts there are Negroes,
does not argue for the criminality of the race, but its poverty. Negroes
do not profit by the maladministration of criminal justice in Chicago,
because they have not the money to hire the right kind of shyster
lawyers to defend them. The criminal laws of Illinois were not made by
the people for their protection.</p>
