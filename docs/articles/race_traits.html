<p><span class="pagenum">3</span></p>
<p>In August, 1896, there was published, under the auspices of the
American Economic Association, a work entitled “Race Traits and
Tendencies of the American Negro,” by Frederick L. Hoffman, F.S.S.,
statistician to the Prudential Insurance Company of America. This work
presents by far the most thorough and comprehensive treatment of the
Negro problem, from a statistical standpoint, which has yet appeared. In
fact, it may be regarded as the most important utterance on the subject
since the publication of “Uncle Tom’s Cabin;” for the interest which the
famous novel aroused in the domain of sentiment and generous feelings,
the present work seems destined to awaken in the field of science and
exact inquiry.</p>
<p>Mr. Hoffman has spent ten years in painful and laborious
investigation of the subject, during which time he has been in touch
with the fullest sources of information, and has had the advice and
assistance of the highest living authorities in statistics and social
science. The temper of mind which he brought to this study may be judged
from his own words: “Being of foreign birth, a German, I was fortunately
free from a personal bias which might have made an impartial treatment
of the subject difficult.”<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> There are other
assurances that the author possesses no personal animosity or repugnance
against the Negro as such. But, freedom from conscious personal bias
does not relieve the author from the imputation of partiality to his own
opinions beyond the warrant of the facts which he has presented. Indeed,
it would seem that his conclusion was reached from <em>a priori</em>
considerations and that facts have been collected in order to justify
it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">4</span> The main conclusion of the work is
that the Negro race in America is deteriorating physically and morally
in such manner as to point to ulterior extinction, and that this decline
is due to “race traits” rather than to conditions and circumstances of
life. Not only do we find this conclusion expressly set forth in
connection with every chapter, but it is also easily discernible in foot
notes and quotations, in the general drift of cited references, and
between the lines. In order to give the clearest possible statement of
the author’s position his own words will be used.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The conditions of life therefore … would seem to be of less
importance than race and heredity.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not the <em>conditions of life</em> but in <em>the race traits
and tendencies</em> that we find the causes of the excessive
mortality.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For the root of the evil lies in the fact of an immense amount of
immorality, which is a race trait.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A combination of these traits and tendencies must in the end cause
the extinction of the race.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not in the conditions of life but in race and heredity that we
find the explanation.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The mixture of the African with the white race has been shown to have
seriously affected the longevity of the former and left as a heritage to
future generations the poison of scrofula, tuberculosis, and most of
all, of syphilis.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the reader will keep constantly in mind the key suggested by these
quotations, he will peruse the book itself as well as this review with
greater ease and facility.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-i.-population">Chapter I. Population</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>For some generations the colored element may continue to make
decennial gains, but it is very probable that the next thirty years will
be the last to show total gains, and then the decrease will be slow but
sure until final disappearance.</em> <a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have taken this quotation from another work by the same author as
it represents more clearly than any other condensed statement the
substance of the present chapter. This proposition is a most<span
class="pagenum"><span id="Page_5">5</span></span> important one, and
therefore its establishment needs to be inquired into with the greatest
particularity. If a race does not possess the requisite physical
stamina, it is impossible for it to maintain a high degree of moral and
intellectual culture or compete with its more vigorous rivals in the
race of civilization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All the elements of society are conserved in its physical basis, the
social population.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the author relies mainly upon the eleventh census for facts to
establish his conclusion, and since the accuracy of this census is
widely controverted, we may fairly call upon him to prove his document
before it can be admitted in evidence.</p>
<p>The following quotation from Senator Mills reflects the opinion of
many eminent students of public problems as to the accuracy of this
enumeration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The announcement that our population is only 62,662,250 was a genuine
surprise, not only to those who looked for the dark side of the picture,
but also to those whose faith in the administration and its census
bureau had never for a moment wavered. The census of 1880 gave
50,155,783. The present returns give an increase of 12,466,476, which is
at the rate of 24.86 per cent. That this number is not even
approximately correct may be seen by comparing the increase in this
decade with the gain in others which have preceded it. Any alleged fact
that is without the pale of probability stands impeached at the very
threshold of the inquiry, and must be verified by competent
evidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basing his estimates upon the school census, the Senator continues:
“The state of Texas is deprived, by the incorrect returns, of at least
three representatives in Congress. Alabama loses 240,000, Tennessee and
North Carolina 170,000 each, and Virginia, Kentucky, and Louisiana
100,000 each.”<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Whatever force there may be in the
protest of the eloquent Texas Senator, applies with special emphasis to
the colored element; for it goes without saying that errors in
enumeration in the South would be confined mainly to the Negro race, and
since the bulk of the race is confined to this section such errors would
have a most disastrous effect upon its rate of increase as shown by the
census reports.</p>
<p>The following table exhibits the development of the colored
population for the last one hundred years, as well as its decennial
rates of increase and percentage of the total population.</p>

<p>If we begin with 1810, the first census year after the constitutional
suppression of the slave trade, we see from this table that the growth
of the Negro element followed the ordinary law of population, viz: a
gradual decline in the rate of increase. In 70 years the decennial rate
of increase declined from about 30 per cent to 22 per cent. But from
1880 to 1890 there was a <em>per saltum</em> decrease from 22 to 13 per
cent—that is, the decline in ten years was equal to that of the previous
seventy. And all this has happened during an era of profound peace and
prosperity, when the Negro population was subject to no great perturbing
influences. When a number of observations follow with reasonable
uniformity a fixed law, but a single result deviates widely from this
law it is usual to suspect the accuracy of the discrepant observation.
The author nowhere assigns any adequate cause for this sudden “slump” in
the increase of the colored population. Instead of attributing it, in
part at least, to the probable imperfection of the eleventh census, he
relies wholly upon a blind force recently discovered and named by him
“race traits and tendencies.” The capriciousness of this new factor, in
that it may suspend operation indefinitely or break loose in a day, does
not seem to have occurred to the author, at least it does not seem to
affect the confident assurance with which he relies upon it. As has been
shrewdly remarked by an able reviewer, “It would seem incumbent on him
(Mr. Hoffman) further to prove that these race traits, after being held
in abeyance for at least a century, first took decisive action in the
decade 1880 to 1890.”<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><span id="Page_7">7</span></span>In 1810 there
were 1,377,808 Negroes in the United States. In 80 years this number had
swollen to at least 7,470,040, and that, too, without reinforcement from
outside immigration. It more than quintupled itself in eight decades.
Does it not require much fuller demonstration than the author anywhere
presents to convince the ordinary mind that a people that has shown such
physical vitality for so long a period, has all at once, in a single
decade, become comparatively infecund and threatened with
extinction?</p>
<p>It is passing strange that it escaped the attention of a statistician
of Mr. Hoffman’s sagacity that, even granting the accuracy of the
eleventh census, the natural increase of the Negro race was greater than
that of the whites during the last decade. The number of immigrants who
came to this country between 1880 and 1890 was 5,246,613. I am informed
by the census bureau that this number does not include the immigrants
who came from British North America and from Mexico after 1885. This
number was estimated by the statistical bureau of the Treasury
Department to be 540,000, making the total number of immigrants
5,787,613. If this number be subtracted from the increase of the white
population during the last decade (11,589,920) their rate of increase
will be reduced to 13.35 per cent as compared with 13.51 per cent for
the blacks. Nor is this all. The immigrants were for the most part in
the full maturity and vigor of their productive powers, being the most
fecund element of our white population. If allowance be made for their
natural increase from 1880 to 1890 the white race would show a decennial
increase appreciably below that of the blacks. If the Negro, then, is
threatened with extinction, the white race is in a still more pitiable
plight.</p>
<p>The table on page 6 does indeed show plainly that the Negro does not
hold his own as a numerical factor of our mixed population. Whereas he
represented 19 per cent of the entire population in 1810 he now
represents only 12 per cent. But the cause of this relative decline is
apparent enough. It is due to white immigration and not to “race traits”
as Mr. Hoffman would have us believe. It would be as legitimate to
attribute the decline of the Yankee element as a numerical factor in the
large New England centers to the race degeneracy of the Puritan, while
ignoring the proper cause—the influx of the Celt.</p>
<p>Mr. Hoffman’s conclusions as to the Negro population are not
generally accepted by students of social problems. Their position<span
class="pagenum"><span id="Page_8">8</span></span> is more clearly stated
in a recent notice of the work now under review.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Concerning the first of these chapters dealing with population he
(Mr. Hoffman) reaches conclusions very different from those generally
held by those who have discussed the subject on <em>a priori</em>
grounds. The general impression has been that the colored population was
increasing at a rate greater than that of the whites, owing both to the
greater number of children born and also to the fact that all children
of a mixed race were counted as blacks. From such a condition of affairs
it would naturally be assumed that the race to which all half-breeds
were credited would, especially if prolific, rapidly gain upon the other
race.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the appearance of each census since emancipation, there has been
some hue and cry as to the destiny of the Negro population. Public
opinion has been rhythmical with reference to its rise and fall above
and below the mean line of truth. In 1870 it was extermination; in 1880
it was dreaded that the whole country would be Africanized because of
the prolificness of a barbarous race; in 1890 the doctrine of extinction
was preached once more; what will be the outcry in 1900 can only be
divined at this stage, but we may rest assured that it will be something
startling.</p>
<h3 id="negroes-in-cities">Negroes in Cities</h3>
<p>The author’s studies in the minor features of the Negro population
form the most interesting and valuable work which has yet been
undertaken on the subject. The urban drift, the tendency to
concentration, and the migratory movements of the black population are
treated with fullness and force. It is interesting to know that there
are 13 cities in which the colored population exceeds 20,000, and 23 in
which it exceeds 10,000, and that the rate of increase of the colored
element in these centers is enormous—more than 30 per cent. The
concentration of the colored population in certain sections of <span
class="pagenum"><span id="Page_9">9</span></span>cities is quite
suggestive. The following table will disclose some of the striking
features which Mr. Hoffman has exhibited at length.<a href="#fn14"

<p>This tendency to concentration in undesirable places is found to be
greater in Northern than in Southern cities. Every large city has its
white wards and its black wards, which the politician knows as well as
the seaman knows the depths and shallows of the sea.</p>
<p>The evil of this tendency cannot be denied or gainsaid; but its cause
is not far to seek nor hard to find.</p>
<h3 id="black-belts">Black Belts</h3>
<p>The author also notes with alarm that the Negro population is
congesting in the black belts of the South. There are 70 counties in
this section with an aggregate area of over 50,000 square miles in which
the colored population outnumbers the white nearly three to one. The
general conviction is that the Negroes will be gathered into black
settlements scattered throughout the Gulf states. The superintendent of
the tenth census writes on this subject:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I entertain a strong conviction that the further course of our
(Negro) population will exhibit that tendency in a continually growing
force; that this element will be more and more drained off from the
higher and colder lands into the low, hot regions bordering on the Gulf
of Mexico.”<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Commenting on this subject Mr. Hoffman says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This tendency if persisted in will probably in the end prove
disastrous to the advancement of the colored race, since there is but
the slightest prospect that the race will be lifted to a higher plane of
civilization except by constant contact with the white race.”<a
href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is undoubtedly true that the Negro has not the initiative power of
civilization. What race has? Civilization is not an original<span
class="pagenum"><span id="Page_10">10</span></span> process with any
race or nation known to history. The torch has been passed from race to
race and from age to age. Where else can the Negro go? The white race at
present has the light. This concession is no reproach to the Negro race,
nor is it due to any peculiar race trait or tendency.</p>
<p>There is a stretch of country extending from southern Pennsylvania to
northern Alabama, containing sections of Maryland, West Virginia,
Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky,
and Alabama, and embracing the Appalachian system of mountains. This
section contains a population of nearly 3,000,000 souls. They belong for
the most part to the most thrifty element of our complex population—an
element whose toughness of moral and mental fiber is proverbial. The
Scotch-Irish are famed the world over for their manly and moral vigor.
And yet this people have sunken to the lowest depth of poverty and
degradation—a depth from which, without the assistance of outside help,
they can be lifted nevermore.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> Is this condition of
depravity and inability of self-initiative due to “race traits and
tendencies?”</p>
<p>Then, supposing the Negroes to be concentrated in the black belts, as
seems inevitable, will they necessarily be shut out from wholesome
contact with civilization? Not at all. Just how far personal and servile
contact can elevate the moral and manly tone of a people is not quite
evident. But the result of indirect missionary contact is, perhaps, the
surest way to lift a race into civilization. I point to Japan as a
recent, striking illustration of this argument. The black belts will
afford the richest field for missionary and philanthropic endeavor. No
section of this country can remain long in an uncivilized state or
relapse into barbarism that has in its midst a Hampton Institute or a
Booker T. Washington.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-2.-vital-statistics">Chapter 2. Vital Statistics</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The vitality of the Negro may well be considered the most
important phase of the so-called race problem, for it is a fact which
can and will be demonstrated by indisputable evidence that of all races
for which statistics are obtainable and which enter at all into the
consideration of economic problems as factors the Negro shows the least
power of resistance in the struggle for life.</em><a href="#fn18"

role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="death-rate-11">Death Rate  <span class="pagenum"><span
id="Page_11">11</span></span></h3>
<p>Statistics are collected from ten of the largest cities with the
result that the death rate among the whites is 20.12 per 1000, and among
the blacks 32.61. It is acknowledged that the great bulk of this excess
in the colored death rate is due to infant mortality. This fact of
itself would suggest that the real cause is condition rather than race
traits. This truth shall be established out of the mouth of
Mr. Hoffman’s own witness. “Fifty per cent of the (Negro) children who
die never receive medical attention.”<a href="#fn19"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>“The indifference to medical attendance in cases of illness of their
children is due to ignorance.”<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> To the ordinary mind
this would imply the most unfortunate condition.</p>
<h3 id="birth-rate">Birth Rate</h3>
<p>But the death rate is only one factor in the vital equation. The
birth rate is equally important. Mr. Hoffman concedes, with reluctant
reservation, that the colored birth rate may be greater than that of the
whites. “That the birth rate of the Negroes is in excess of that of the
white population is probably true even at the present time, at least as
compared with the native whites.”<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> This is indeed a very
feeble admission of a very obvious fact. Mr. Hoffman contends that the
death rate of the Negro race is much greater than that of the whites. It
has already been shown that, leaving immigration out of account, the
increase in the Negro population is greater than that of the white race.
How can these two facts be accounted for except it be on the basis of a
higher birth rate for the blacks? Mr. Hoffman will have either to alter
his estimates or mend his logic.</p>
<p>Direct testimony on this subject must have been known to Mr. Hoffman.
Of course no one is qualified to write on vital statistics in America
who is not familiar with the investigation of Dr. Billings. Let the
reader compare the following quotation as to the relative birth rate of
the races, and, noting date of data upon which the conclusion is based,
decide for himself as to the ingenuousness of Mr. Hoffman’s reluctant
admission:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Billings, in his luminous report on the vital statistics of the
United States (1886) shows that 1000 colored women (age from 15 to 49)
give birth to 164 children,<span class="pagenum"><span
id="Page_12">12</span></span> and 1000 white women to only 127, yearly;
that is to say, three colored women have as many children as four
white.”<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="is-the-negro-threatened-with-extinction">Is the Negro Threatened
with Extinction</h3>
<p>Before Mr. Hoffman’s conclusion as to the threatening aspect of the
high death rate of the Negro race can be accepted, several questions
must be answered by him.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Is the death rate of the colored race higher than that of a
corresponding class of whites subject to the same moral and social
environment? The general opinion is that it is not; nor does the author
attempt to prove the contrary. In discussing this question Dr. John S.
Billings states: “If we could separate the vital statistics of the poor
and ignorant whites, the tenement house population of our Northern
cities, from those of the mass of the white population we should
undoubtedly find a high rate of mortality in this class, and especially
in infancy and childhood.”<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></li>
<li>Is the high death rate for the cities sustained throughout the
country at large? Luckily the census of 1880 gives a complete answer to
this question. The death rate of the United States in 1880 was 15.09 per
1000; South Carolina 15.80; Alabama 14.20; Mississippi 12.89; Georgia
13.97; Massachusetts 18.59; New York 17.38; Pennsylvania 14.92; New
Jersey 16.33. This shows plainly that the Southern states with the
largest Negro contingent do not show any higher death rate than the
Northern states where the Negro is not a considerable factor. There is
no evidence, certainly none brought forward by the author, to show that
the death rate of the Negro in the country at large is much in excess of
that of the whites. “In the rural districts the mortality of the Negro
is not excessive; it is in the cities and towns where he is brought into
close contact with the evils and vices of civilization that he dies so
rapidly.”<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></li>
<li>Is the death rate, even in the cities, so great as to foreshadow
extinction? Nothing is great or small except by comparison. The death
rate among the Negroes in the large cities at present is not as great as
it was among the whites forty years ago; that is, if we may rely upon
the statistics which Mr. Hoffman himself has presented.</li>

<p>This high death rate of the American Negro does not exceed that of

playing such havoc with the Negroes in America, what direful agent of
death, may we ask the author, is at work in the cities of his own

<p>In 1895 it is lower than that of the white soldiers. The same general
law of a gradually decreasing death rate is here revealed.</p>
<p>If the death rate of the Negro population in cities is not higher
than that of corresponding classes of whites; if the records of the
census for the country at large do not show it to be in excess of other
classes; if the highest rates are not above those of the whites a half
century ago, nor higher than those of other civilized communities of the
Caucasian race at the present time; and if this rate is constantly
decreasing under more favorable sanitary appliances—it is hard to
justify the author’s position as to the low vital powers of the race, or
to reach the conclusion that extinction will be its ultimate fate.</p>
<h3 id="the-northern-negroes">The Northern Negroes</h3>
<p>In further proof of the low vitality of the Negro race the author
shows at great length that the race cannot thrive in the North. For
<span class="pagenum"><span id="Page_15">15</span></span>every Northern
community for which statistics are available it appears that the death
rate is in excess of the birth rate. It does not seem to have occurred
to the author that economic and social environment may lead to this
deplorable result. Dr. Walker, in a publication which has already been
referred to, states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The industrial <em>raison d’etre</em> of the Negro is here (in the
South) found at its maximum. In the Northern states this <em>raison
d’etre</em> wholly disappears. There is nothing, aside from a few kinds
of personal service, which the Negro can do which the white man cannot
do as well or perhaps better.”<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the North the Negro race lives in industrial and social captivity;
not being in sufficient numbers to form an independent constituency,
they whine and pine over certain abstract principles of equality and
brotherhood, but which, alas, fade into impalpable air under the
application of a concrete test. They sit in the shadow of the tree of
liberty and boast of its protecting boughs, but must not aspire to
partake of the fruit thereof. The undershrubbery purchases shade and
protection at too dear a price when it sacrifices therefor the
opportunity of the glorious sunlight of heaven. No healthy, vigorous
breed can be produced in the shade. No wonder, then, that the productive
sensitiveness of the Northern Negro is affected by his industrial and
social isolation among an overshadowing people who regard him with a
feeling composed in equal parts of pity and contempt.</p>
<h3 id="consumption-among-negroes">Consumption among Negroes</h3>
<p>The author enters into the causes of mortality and points out that in
addition to infant mortality, which has already been noticed,
consumption, pneumonia, and vicious taints of blood are the most
alarming ones. With gloomy forebodings we are reminded that: “Its (the
Negro race) extreme liability to consumption alone would suffice to seal
its fate as a race.”<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>The following citation will express the truth of the situation as
clearly as it is possible to do:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From close personal observation, embracing a professional life of
nearly forty years among the Negroes and from data obtained from
professional brethren in different sections of the South, I have no
hesitancy in declaring that insanity and tuberculosis were rare diseases
among the Negroes of the South <span class="pagenum"><span
id="Page_16">16</span></span>prior to emancipation. Indeed, many
intelligent people of observation and full acquaintance of the Negro
have stated to me that they never saw a crazy or consumptive Negro of
unmixed blood until these latter years. The fact of their comparative
exemption from these ailments prior to emancipation is so well
established …“<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Man is an organized being, and is subject to certain laws which he
cannot violate with impunity. These laws affect him in the air he
breathes, the food he eats, the clothes he wears, and (in) every
circumstance surrounding his habilitation. In the wholesale violation of
these laws after the war, as previously stated, was laid the foundation
of the degeneration of the physical and mental condition of the Negro.
Licentiousness left its slimy trail of sometimes ineradicable disease
upon his physical being, and neglected bronchitis, pneumonia, and
pleurisy lent their helping hand toward lung degeneration.<a
href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be noticed that Dr. Miller accepts all the facts alleged by
our author, but places the causes squarely upon the ground of
conditions, habits and circumstances of life. He does not seem to be
acquainted with Mr. Hoffman’s discovery of “race traits.” The fact that
under the hygienic and dietary regime of slavery, consumption was
comparatively unknown among Negroes, but that under the altered
conditions of emancipation it has developed to a threatening degree,
would persuade any except the man with a theory, that the cause is due
to the radical changes in life which freedom imposed upon the blacks,
rather than to some malignant, capricious “race trait” which is not
amenable to the law of cause and effect, but which graciously suspended
its operation for two hundred years, and has now mysteriously selected
the closing decades of the nineteenth century in which to make a trial
of its direful power.</p>
<p>No people who work all day in the open air of a mild climate and who
sleep at night in huts and cabins where crack and crevice and skylight
admit abundant ventilation, will be subject to pulmonary weakness. Now
take the same people and transplant them to the large cities of a colder
climate, subject them to pursuits which do not call for a high degree of
bodily energy, crowd them into alley tenements where the windows are
used only for ornament and to keep <span class="pagenum"><span
id="Page_17">17</span></span>out the “night air,” and a single door must
serve for entrance, exit, and ventilation, and lung degeneration is the
inevitable result. The cause of the evil suggests the remedy. The author
in a previous chapter points out the threatening evil of crowding into
the cities; a counter movement which would cause a return to the
country, or would at least stay the mad urban movement, would not only
improve the economic status of the race but would also benefit its
physical and moral health. Here is an open field for practical
philanthropy and wise Negro leadership.</p>
<p>The increase in consumption among Negroes is indeed a grave matter,
but it is possible to exaggerate its importance as sociological
evidence. If we listen to the alarmists and social agitators, we would
find a hundred causes, each of which would destroy the human race in a
single generation. The most encouraging evidence on this subject from
the Negro’s point of view is afforded by the last report of the Surgeon
General of the United States Army. The statistics thus furnished are the
most valuable for comparative study, since they deal with the two races
on terms of equality, that is, the white and colored men are of about
the same ages and initial condition of health, they receive the same
treatment and are subject to the same diet, work, and social habits. “It
is to be noted, also,” says the Surgeon General, “that during the past
two years the rates for consumption among the colored troops have fallen
so as to be much lower than those for the whites, whereas formerly they
were much higher.”<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>The following table prepared by Mr. Hershaw, shows plainly the
gradual decrease of the death rate from consumption in Southern cities

<p>It appears that the total death rate as well as that due to
consumption among Negroes reached the maximum about 1880 and has been on
the gradual decline ever since.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><span id="Page_18">18</span></span>Consumption
is only one of the contributing causes of the total death rate. It has
been shown that the death rate from all causes does not necessarily
point to the extinction of the race. This being so, there is no need of
unnecessary alarm over a single factor; for in sociology, as in
mathematics, we cannot escape the fundamental truth that the whole is
greater than any of its parts.</p>
<h3 id="vital-capacity-and-economic-efficiency">Vital Capacity and
Economic Efficiency</h3>
<p>The author’s proposition as to the low vitality of the Negro and its
effect upon his economic efficiency is contrary alike to the traditional
and prevalent belief. The whole fabric of slavery rested upon the
assumption that the Negro was better able to resist the trying condition
of the southern climate than the white laborer. The industrial
reconstruction of the South is building upon the same foundation. No one
doubts that the Negro is able to resist certain miasmatic and febrific
diseases which are so destructive to the white race in the tropical
regions of the earth. Science and wise hygienic appliances have improved
the condition of the white race in this respect, it is true, but will
not the same appliances benefit the Negro in the same degree?</p>
<p>Dr. Daniel H. Williams, surgeon-in-chief of the Freedmen’s Hospital,
at Washington, D. C., informs me that during his professional experience
he has performed upward of 3000 surgical operations, one-fourth of which
at least were upon white patients, and that he has found unmistakable
evidence of higher vital power among the colored patients. I am also
informed that this is the general opinion of the medical profession.</p>
<p>Although the author treats exhaustively the whole catalogue of
diseases and the numerous ills which flesh is heir to, it can be safely
claimed that he does not establish his main proposition set forth in the
beginning of the chapter, and that at least a Scotch verdict is
demanded: “not proven.”   ## Chapter III. Anthropometry</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In vital capacity, the most important of all physiological
characteristics, the tendency of the race has been downward.</em><a
href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ample statistics are presented to show that in proportion to
structure<span class="pagenum"><span id="Page_19">19</span></span> the
Negro is heavier than the white man. This fact, the author tells us, is
ordinarily considered favorable to a healthy development and freedom
from pulmonary weakness. “The elaborate investigations of the medical
department of the New York Mutual Life, in 1874, of the Washington Life,
in 1886, the Prudential Insurance Company of America, in 1895, and the
New York Mutual Life, in 1895, prove conclusively that low weight in
proportion to age and stature is a determining factor in the
susceptibility of an individual to consumption.”<a href="#fn37"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>In order to explain away this apparent advantage in favor of the
Negro, the author has invented a unique physiological principle, viz: “A
physiological law may hold good for one race and not for another.”<a
href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> It is noticeable that the author
applies this principle only when it suits his convenience but withholds
it whenever it runs across his theory.</p>
<p>By a series of measurements based, confessedly, upon insufficient
data, it is concluded that the Negro has a smaller lung capacity,
smaller chest expansion, and a higher rate of respiration than the white
man, and that the Mulatto is inferior to both the parent races in these
vital functions. These differences are considered a powerful factor in
lung degeneration, and proof positive of physical inferiority. In these
respects he tacitly repudiates his erstwhile principle that “a
physiological law may hold good for one race and not for another,” and
assumes that the two races are subject to like conditions of disease and
death.</p>
<p>On the whole it may be said that this is the least interesting
chapter in the whole book. The data are so slender and the arguments are
so evidently shaped to a theory, that we are neither enlightened by the
one nor convinced by the other. But the author’s judgment must be
justified. The gloomy warning comes with Catonian regularity at the end
of each chapter. Listen to his last words: “A combination of these
traits and tendencies must in the end cause the extinction of the
race.”<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>If the Negro is inferior in vital function and power to the
Caucasian, he will be a public benefactor who scientifically
demonstrates the fact. But the colored race most stubbornly refuses to
be argued out of existence on an insufficient induction of data and
unwarranted conclusions deduced therefrom.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-iv.-amalgamation-20">Chapter IV. Amalgamation <span
class="pagenum"><span id="Page_20">20</span></span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The crossing of the Negro race with the white has been
detrimental to its true progress and has contributed more than anything
else to the excessive and increasing rate of mortality from the most
fatal disease, as well as to its consequent inferior social efficiency
and diminishing power as a force in American national life.</em><a
href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The importance of this proposition is apparent when we consider that
the Negroes in this country are a thoroughly mixed people. The pure
African type has been well nigh obliterated. It is pointed out also that
the mongrel progeny has been produced by illicit intercourse between the
white male and the black female. The moral and conservative qualities of
a race reside in its womanhood. The Negro people, then, have missed
these transmitted qualities. The author is either ignorant of or ignores
the large class of mixed Negroes who are the legitimate offspring of
colored parents, but would place the whole class under the ban of
bastardy.</p>
<p>After judicially balancing the testimony furnished by world-renowned
authorities upon the effect of race crossing, the author espouses one
side of the contention with all the ardor of a retained advocate.</p>
<p>Three points are sought to be established.</p>
<h3 id="i.-the-mulatto-is-physically-inferior-to-both-parent-races.">I.
The Mulatto is Physically Inferior to both Parent Races.</h3>
<p>The opinions of examining surgeons during the civil war are quoted
which quite unanimously show that the Mulatto is strongly inclined to
consumption, scrofula, and vicious taints of blood.</p>

<p>It appears from this table that in the most important vital organs
and functions the Mulatto is inferior to both parent stocks. This <span
class="pagenum"><span id="Page_21">21</span></span>opinion is almost or
quite universal among competent authorities upon this subject. And yet
the last word of science has not been uttered on this question. There is
no subject in all the domain of social science which offers a more
interesting or more fruitful field for investigation. The Freedmen’s
Hospital at Washington, and similar institutions elsewhere, by
prosecuting accurate and scientific methods of inquiry can throw much
light upon this subject.</p>
<h3 id="the-mulatto-is-morally-inferior-to-the-blacks.">2. The Mulatto
is Morally Inferior to the Blacks.</h3>
<p>This alleged inferiority is attributable to the fact as well as to
the manner of generation. Strangely enough Mr. Hoffman does not employ
the statistics which would seem to bear out his suggestion. The eleventh
census shows that there were 10,377 pure and 3,218 mixed Negroes in
penitentiaries in 1890. Supposing that uniform methods of race-tests
were used throughout the census inquiry, this would show that while the
mixed Negroes constitute only 16 per cent of the total Negro population,
they furnished 30 percent of the penitentiary convicts. But these
figures cannot be relied upon since the census bureau acknowledges that
it has no definite method of determining the different shades of color
and grades of mixture among Negroes.</p>
<p>It is also alleged in proof of this proposition that illicit
intercourse between the races is carried on mainly with the Mulatto
women. Can this not be explained on grounds other than native depravity?
The light-colored Negro woman is made the victim of the lustful
onslaught of the male element of both races. She is placed between the
upper and nether stress of the vicious propensities of white and black
men. And if her sins are greater, is it not because her temptations are
greater also? The following quotation from a distinguished Southerner is
significant; “There was little improper intercourse between white men
and Negresses of the original type in the period before emancipation
(after the creation of the Mulatto class).”<a href="#fn41"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a>
Every time a Negro woman is indicted on this score some white man is
inculpated. The reproach hurled against colored women from such sources
reminds us very much of the lines in Butler’s Hudibras:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The selfsame thing they will abhor,<br />
One way, and long another for.</p>

The Mulatto is Intellectually Superior to the Blacks but Inferior to the
Whites. <span class="pagenum"><span id="Page_22">22</span></span></h3>
<p>In substantiation of this proposition it is claimed that the greater
number of Negroes who have attained distinction have been those of mixed
blood. The truth of this statement must be conceded, and yet the cause
should not be overlooked. Leaving aside the doctrine of inheritance as a
debatable question, the initial advantage of the mixed over the pure
Negroes was considerable. Feelings of blood ties prompted many a slave
holder to deal kindly by his slave descendants, and often to liberate
them and give them a start in the race of life. That an infusion of
white blood quickens the energy and enlivens the disposition of the
progeny is probably true; but that it adds to the intellectual capacity
is far from a self-evident proposition. The Negroes who have shown any
unusual intellectual activity, in America at least, have usually been of
the purer type. Phyllis Wheatly, Benjamin Banneker, Ira Aldridge, Blind
Tom, Edward W. Blyden, and Paul Dunbar are illustrations of this
argument.</p>
<p>The investigation of Dr. Gould as to circumference of head and facial
angle are exhibited in the following table:</p>

<p>A difference of one-tenth of an inch in head circumference and of

<p>Twenty-four cases are taken to represent fifty million people, and
<span class="pagenum"><span id="Page_23">23</span></span>the law of
averages thus obtained is confidently relied upon. Nor are we informed
as to what methods were employed to ascertain the exact composition of
blood of the 22 cases that are rated as one-sixteenth white. But,
supposing we accept this table, overlooking for the time being the fact
that the brain weight of one white person is taken as typical of two
million others, and also conceding the undisclosed method of Dr. Hunt in
detecting homeopathic dashes of white blood, does it “clearly prove that
there is an increase in the brain weight with an increase in the
proportion of white blood?” If this table shows anything it is that the
pure Negro and the Mulatto have about the same brain weight and that
they are both superior in this respect to all degrees of mixture between
them, but inferior to those of more than one-half white blood.</p>
<p>But it is rather unusual at this late day to base intellectual
capacity upon the shape and size of skull. Investigations have shown
that facial angle and capacity of cranium and cephalic index afford no
certain criterion of thought power or susceptibility to culture. The
latest word on this subject is given by Prof. Ripley, in a series of
articles on “Racial Geography of Europe,” in Appleton’s *Popular Science
Monthly8 for 1897.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An important point to be noted in this connection is that this shape
of the head seems to bear no direct relation to intellectual power or
intelligence. Posterior development of the cranium does not imply a
corresponding backwardness in culture. … Europe offers the best
refutation of the statement that the proportions of the head mean
anything intellectual. … In our study of the proportions of the head,
therefore, we are measuring merely race, and not intelligence in any
sense. … Equally unimportant to the anthropologist is the absolute size
of the head. It is grievous to contemplate the waste of energy when,
during our civil war, over one million of soldiers had their heads
measured in respect to this absolute size, in view of the fact that
today anthropologists deny any considerable significance attaching to
this characteristic. Popularly a large head with beetling eyebrows
suffices to establish a man’s intellectual credit, but like all other
credit it is entirely dependent upon what lies on deposit elsewhere.<a
href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A still more renowned authority tells us: “The development of the
intellectual faculties of man is to a great extent independent of the
capacity of the cranium and the volume of the brain.”<a href="#fn44"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><span id="Page_24">24</span></span>The question
of the relative intellectual capacity of the different races is one of
much speculative interest. I am giving the matter more attention than it
would seem to warrant, because the author makes the supposed mental
inferiority of the race the basis of the only practical suggestion which
he has to offer, viz: that all of our educational and philanthropic
endeavor so far has been based upon wrong principles, and a radical
change in this regard is demanded so as to bring the treatment in
harmony with the capabilities of the lower race. Several authorities
will be cited which, I think, will be more than sufficient to offset
Mr. Hoffman’s insistent opinion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are hundreds if not thousands of black men in this country who
in capacity are to be ranked with the superior persons of the dominant
race; and it is hard to say that in any evident feature of mind they
characteristically differ from their white fellow citizens.”<a
href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prof. Shaler is himself a Southerner, a professor in Harvard
University, and a noted student of current problems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Granting the present inferiority of the Negro, we affirm that it has
never been proved; nor is there any good reason to suppose that he is
doomed forever to maintain his present relative position, or that he is
inferior to the white man in any other sense than as some white races
are inferior to others.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet the Negro children exhibit no intellectual inferiority; they make
just the same progress in the subjects taught as do the children of
white parents, and the deficiency they exhibit later in life is of quite
a different kind.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Hoffman compels us once more to combat the arguments of the slave
holding class: that is, that the Negro is intellectually and morally an
inferior creature (they did not, however, affirm physical inferiority)
and that it is only by servile contact with the white race that his
nature can be improved. The progress along these lines which the race
has made even under the severest disadvantages is sufficient answer to
this argument.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I’m designed yon lordling’s slave,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By nature’s law designed,</span><br />
Why was an independent wish<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">E’er planted in my mind?</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><span id="Page_25">25</span></span>The Negro’s
intellectual and social environments hang as a millstone about his neck;
and when he is cast upon the sea of opportunity he is reproached with
everlasting inferiority because he does not swim an equal race with
those who are not thus fettered. We are reminded of the barbarous
Teutons in Titus Andronicus who, after pulling out the tongue and
cutting off the hands of the lovely Lavinia, upbraid her for not calling
for sweet water with which to wash her delicate hands.</p>
<p>No, no, Mr. Hoffman, the philanthropists have made no mistake. They
have proceeded on the supposition that the Negro has faculty for faculty
and power for power with the rest of his fellow men, and that his
special needs grow out of his peculiar condition. Any alteration in this
policy would violate the dictates both of science and humanity.</p>
<h3 id="mixed-marriages">Mixed Marriages</h3>
<p>The remainder of this rather long chapter is devoted to the number
and character of mixed marriages, with the conclusion that the number is
on the decrease and the character of one or both of the contracting
parties is usually unsavory, and that such unions can form no
determining factor in the ultimate solution of the problem.</p>
<p>A study of the fertility of such marriages and the physical, moral,
and intellectual stamina of the progeny would furnish valuable
sociological data.</p>

<p>Under the sub-heads of religion and education statistics are
presented showing the progress of the race along these lines. A total

every 2.79 of the Negro population, against one in every 3.04 for the
whites. There were 1,288,736 pupils in the common schools and 34,129 in
the higher schools, colleges, and universities. Ordinarily these facts
are regarded as the most wonderful evidences of progress which the world
has ever witnessed on the part of a backward people. But not so with Mr.
Hoffman; the necessities of his <span class="pagenum"><span
id="Page_26">26</span></span>theories compel him to explain away every
apparent advantage in favor of the Negro. The author announces with an
implied negative response to the suppressed question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It remains to be shown whether the educational process which the race
has undergone during the past quarter of a century and the additional
efforts and opportunities for religious instruction have materially
raised the race from its low social and economic condition at the time
of emancipation.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"

<p>The Negro element, which constitutes only 12 per cent of the
population, commits 30 per cent of the crimes. Before concluding that
this preponderance of crime is due to “race traits,” let us examine more
closely into the circumstances of the case. The discrepancy in the
administration of the law in the South has undoubtedly some effect upon
this relative showing. In order to escape the charge of slander, I will
use the words of a distinguished Virginian who boasts of “my southern
ancestry, birth, rearing, residence and interest.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And is not the law the same for all, and does it make any distinction
between rich and poor, white and black? Literally, the law is the same
for all. Then what more can be desired? The trouble is not that the laws
are partial, through some of its enactments, namely, the whipping-post,
chain-gang, and poll-tax laws, were aimed principally against the Negro;
but the trouble is with the interpretation of the laws by the juries,
who merely voice the <span class="pagenum"><span
id="Page_27">27</span></span>public sentiment, which is superior to the
law itself. The average jury is a whimsical creature, subject to all
kinds of influences, though mostly of a sentimental character. In
criminal matters where whites are concerned, it seems ever to lean to
the defense; and the strongest arguments of the prosecution are easily
offset and upset by appeals on behalf of youth, family, station,
respectability, etc.; or, perhaps the whole family, weeping, is placed
in full view of the jury, and the susceptible jury, sure at least in
such cases to weep with them that weep, speedily brings in a verdict of
acquittal where guilt is clearly manifest; or it says jail where it
ought to say penitentiary; or one year where it ought to say ten; and
ten years where it ought to pronounce death. But the Negro has none of
these sentimental advantages. Too poor to employ competent counsel, his
liberty and life are necessarily committed to incompetent hands, when
the proverb of ‘poor pay, poor preach’ becomes reality. … But are
Negroes treated unfairly by juries and public opinion? Yes, and the
experience and observation of every fair-minded man will confirm the
assertion. One cardinal proof is that a white man seldom receives
punishment for assault, however brutal, however unprovoked, however
cowardly, be it maiming, homicide, or murder upon a Negro unless,
forsooth, the assailant be some degraded creature, disowned by his own
caste. Of the numberless instances—running into the thousands—during the
past twenty-three years, of homicide and murder of blacks by whites,
there is no single instance of capital punishment, and few, very few,
instances of imprisonment beyond a few months in jail, or a slight fine.
The fact is the juries, which are the sole judges of the evidence, will
accept testimony against a Negro that they would reject in the case of
whites; and on the other hand they will frequently reject, or at least
discredit, testimony of the Negro against the white man, however well
supported it may be. But to compound for sins we are inclined to by
damning those we have no mind to, in case of any difficulty between
white and black, and the former is injured or loses his life, lucky is
the latter if the homicide is not declared murder—when courts of
justice, though sure to inflict the highest penalty in his case, are
found to be too slow, and he is dragged forth and slain, unshrived and
unshriven, as if he were a monstrous wild beast of whose presence earth
could not be rid too quickly.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><span id="Page_28">28</span></span>The social
degradation of the Negro is the greatest factor contributive to this
high criminal record. We naturally associate poverty, ignorance, and
crime as being indissolubly connected. The Negroes represent the stratum
of society which commits the bulk of crime the world over. If we
exchange places the same story would be narrated of the whites. The
census records nowhere show that there is any connection between crime
and race, but between crime and condition.</p>
<p>The Negro has a higher criminal record than the Caucasian, it is
true, but so has the foreigner a greater average than the native whites.
The strongest possible argument in this connection rests upon the fact
that the presence of a large number of Negroes in any community does not
increase its total criminal average. The North Atlantic division,
including the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, has a
criminal record of 833.1 to the million, while the South Atlantic
division, including the states of the Southern Atlantic coast shows a
record of 831.7. The Western division has an average of 1300. The
section that has the fewest Negroes has the highest average, and the
states that have the largest quota of blacks show the lowest criminal
rates. If we compare state with state the same interesting results are
revealed. The criminal record of New York (million basis) is 1369, of
South Carolina 702.6, of California 1703, of Alabama 720.1.</p>
<p>But, says the objector, a difference in the rigidity of the
enforcement of the law may account in some measure for this disparity.
Let us then take the city of Washington, one-third of whose population
are Negroes, and compare its police reports with those of Boston, whose
Negro element is a negligible fraction. It will be conceded, I think,
that the enforcement of law in both cities is rigid. The major of police
for the District of Columbia, in his last report remarks: ”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those familiar with the conduct of police affairs in this country
generally contend that there is a constant increase of crime; that it
keeps pace with the growing population. While such may be true of the
principal cities of the United States, facts and figures support the
claim of this department that in this respect the District of Columbia
occupies a distinct standing of its own. Its comprehensive moral status
is above that of most communities. Were it not for the depredations
chargeable to theft, there would be comparatively little crime to
chronicle. This offense must always exist<span class="pagenum"><span
id="Page_29">29</span></span> here, unless through some unexpected
agency a complete change should be effected in the social conditions
which prevail. The abiding place of a large class of idle, illiterate,
and consequently vicious persons, it is but reasonable that the
respectable element should be preyed upon to a considerable extent.<a
href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The percentage of arrests for Boston during 1896 was 9.37, whereas
for Washington it was only 8 and a fraction. These facts would seem to
furnish sufficient evidence that crime adheres to circumstances and
condition and not to race and color.</p>
<p>But, says the author, in the North (where legal processes are
acknowledgedly fair so far as the Negro is concerned) the race shows a
criminal record which is out of all proportion to its numerical
strength. In Pennsylvania 2.23 per cent of its population commit 16.16
per cent of the crimes; in Chicago 1.30 of the population are
responsible for 9.84 of the offenses, and so for other Northern
communities. The Negro’s criminal status is from six to eight times
greater than his numerical weight. It has been shown in another place
that from a social and economic standpoint the Northern Negro is
completely submerged. The criminal outbreak under the circumstances is
only natural.</p>
<p>It is also true that where numbers are small proportions are high.
The startling criminal showing of the Northern Negro can be accounted
for largely on this principle. Suppose that there were but one Chinaman
in a community, and coming, as he naturally would, into hostile contact
with a wide area, he should be arrested and convicted. The criminal
records of that community would show that one hundred per cent of the
Chinese population belonged to the criminal class.</p>
<p>I append the following table, extracted from the census of 1880, to
establish this principle. The Negro in the country at large shows a much
higher criminal rate than the foreign whites, but if we limit our
inquiry to those states where the foreign population is small, the
conditions will be reversed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><span id="Page_30">30</span></span>If, on the
other hand, we select those states in which the Negro element is small
and the foreign element large the result is very decidedly to the
disadvantage of the Negro.</p>
<p>The Northern Negro has a criminal record which is not only out of all
proportion to his numerical strength, but is two or three times as great
as that of his black brothers in the South. It is hard to see how “race
traits” could account for this discrepancy.</p>
<h3 id="rape-and-lynching">Rape and Lynching</h3>
<p>The attempts at rape and the consequent lynchings are also offered in
evidence of the evil propensity of the race. It is undoubtedly true that
the alleged assaults upon white women by colored men have done more than
all other causes combined to give the race an evil reputation and make
it loathsome in the eyes of mankind. “It throws over every colored man a
mantle of odium and sets upon him a mark for popular hate more
distressing than the mark set upon the first murderer … It has cooled
our friends and heated our enemies.”<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>The alleged culprit in such cases, especially if he be a colored man
and the victim a white woman, is almost certain to die without due
process of law. The native, savage furor of human nature asserts itself
in the presence of such dastardly outrages, and neither legal enactments
nor moral codes nor religious sanction can restrain it. The perpetrators
cannot be defended or pitied. It is a waste of sympathy to wail over the
deep damnation of their taking off. And yet we must remember that when
the two races are concerned rape has a larger definition than is set
down in the dictionaries. There can be no doubt that there have been
many lynchings chargeable to rape, when the true cause should be
designated by a different, though an ugly name.</p>
<p>Let us not forget, also, that not more than one-third of the
lynchings are even chargeable to rape. The causes include the whole
catalogue of offenses, serious and trifling, from the committal of
murder to jostling against a white man on the street. The attempt to
show that lynching and rape are coextensive is misleading and
unjust.</p>
<p>So the effort to show that rapeful assaults are due to “race traits”
can, I think, be clearly disproved. In a pamphlet which is certainly
<span class="pagenum"><span id="Page_31">31</span></span>not flattering
to the Negro, a learned medical authority tells us:</p>
<p>I might remark in passing that, notwithstanding the horrible crimes
perpetrated under the influence of the <em>furor sexualis</em> by the
Negro, I believe that he compares quite favorably as regards sexual
impulses—taking all abnormalities into consideration—with the white
race. The more I see of white men in so-called refined society, the more
contempt have I for quite a large proportion of male humanity.<a
href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>To summarize the points of the argument, showing that rape is not
peculiarly characteristic of the Negro:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Rape has been practiced among all races and nations.</p></li>
<li><p>The committal of rape by white men is by no means an infrequent
occurrence. Two instances of white men committing heinous assaults upon
white children occurred in Washington during the preparation of this
article.</p></li>
<li><p>In Africa rape is so severely punished that it is comparatively
unknown.</p></li>
<li><p>In the British Islands and in South America where the Negroes
live in greatest relative abundance, the crime is unheard of.</p></li>
<li><p>When the care and safety of the white women of the South were
entrusted to the keeping of the slaves, they returned inviolable all
that had been entrusted to their hands.</p></li>
<li><p>Of the hundreds of lady missionaries of the North who have
trusted their lives and virtue to the emancipated race whom they came to
uplift, not a single case of violation has been reported to their
friends at the North.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="social-morality">Social Morality</h3>
<p>The present state of social morality is mirrored in the number of
illegitimate offsprings. The figures which show that the rate of
illegitimacy among Negroes in Washington has increased from 17.60 per
cent of total births in 1879 to 26.46 per cent in 1894 have been widely
quoted and remarked upon. These are facts of record and cannot be
gainsaid or denied. According to the opinion of medical men and others
in positions to observe, these figures if anything fall short of the
truth. It is also probable that the other large cities of the country,
if as closely studied, would make as startling a showing. <span
class="pagenum"><span id="Page_32">32</span></span>The only alarming
feature of the situation is the constant <em>increase</em> in the
illegitimate rates. That twenty-five per cent of the births among
Negroes are illegitimate will not alarm anyone where it is considered
that even this low moral status represents a gain of seventy-five per
cent over the conditions prevailing under slavery.</p>
<p>Mr. Hoffman having on hand a theory, was spared the pains of
inquiring further into the causes which led to this deplorable state of
things. The reviewer suggests that this increase in social immorality
among the Negroes of Washington is due to the great rush of ignorant,
purposeless colored people to the national capital, a condition of
things which always leads, in its first effect, to social looseness and
impurity. The very late marriages among the better element of the
colored people also help to account for this awful state of things. But
perhaps a greater than any cause yet assigned as leading to the social
degradation of Negroes in cities is the excess of the female over the
male element of the population. On account of the importance of this
subject, I append a table showing this excess for the cities whose
colored population is over 20,000.</p>

<p>Such a disproportion between the sexes can forbode no good to
society. In the West, where the male element predominates over the
female among the white population, the evil effect on society is
painfully apparent. If every colored man in Washington were married and
every male minor had a mate selected for him, there would<span
class="pagenum"><span id="Page_33">33</span></span> still be left Negro
females enough to form a manless community larger than Annapolis, Md.
Now, no one should wonder at the moral corruption under these
circumstances. These 8,000 females, for whom marriage is impossible, be
it remembered, are not restrained by the inhibitory influence of pride,
station, and self-esteem. This is no doubt the greatest evil which
threatens the social integrity of Negro life, and forms the most serious
and perplexing of our city problems.</p>
<p>As startling as the records of crime and immorality are, they are
only the outgrowth of circumstances and conditions. Human nature at best
is weak, and under fostering circumstances has always yielded to the
power of sin and uncleanliness. The author tells us that immorality is a
race trait. This is sadly too true, but it is a human race trait, and is
limited to no particular variety thereof.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-vi.-economic-conditions">Chapter VI. Economic
Conditions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>As a general conclusion it may be said that the Negro has not yet
learned the first element of Anglo-Saxon thrift.</em><a href="#fn55"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-negro-as-a-farm-hand">The Negro as a Farm Hand</h3>
<p>Attempt is made to show that the Negro has deteriorated as a farm
laborer, and that as an industrial factor he has not held his own in the
development of the resources of the South. With a process of reasoning
with which we are fully familiar by this time, these assertions are
sought to be upheld. The decline in agricultural interests throughout
the country has had its effect upon the apparent efficiency of the
farming class everywhere. The mad rush to the cities, with a vain hope
of improvement in condition, has well nigh demoralized agricultural
pursuits.</p>
<h3 id="the-negro-as-an-industrial-factor">The Negro as an Industrial
Factor</h3>
<p>The investigations which have been undertaken to determine the
industrial efficiency of the Negro have shown results not unfavorable to
him. The recent discharge of white workmen in the cotton mills of
Charleston, and the substitution of colored workmen in their places, is
quite significant. The hindrances which the Negro has to meet in the
industrial field are fully suggested in the address to <span
class="pagenum"><span id="Page_34">34</span></span>the public of the
discharged white employees of the Charleston establishment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the colored man’s status precludes him from competing with the
office-holder, it should exclude him from competing with our wives,
sons, and daughters in the light pursuits of the country. We affirm, by
our physical powers and brave hearts, not to sit supinely by and witness
this Negro horde turned loose upon the pursuits of our mothers, our
wives, our widows, our daughters, our sisters, and rob them of their
living.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the solemn declaration of 800 workmen in the metropolis of
South Carolina, and represents fairly the white labor sentiment of the
South. The trades unions and labor organizations preach the same
doctrine. If the alleged low industrial efficiency of the Negro is to be
chargeable to race traits, it should be attributed to the domineering
and intolerant race traits of the white workmen who are not disposed to
give the colored man a fair chance. The fact that in almost every
contention between white and colored workmen the employers take the side
of the Negro, is an eloquent argument in behalf of the industrial merits
of the latter; for these employers are in the business for profit and
not for philanthropy.</p>
<h3 id="accumulation-of-property">Accumulation of Property</h3>
<p>The accumulation of property on the part of the blacks shows that in
Georgia they own $12,941,230, in North Carolina $8,018,446, and in
Virginia $13,933,908. The land held by the colored people in Virginia
alone has an area nearly equal to that of the State of Rhode Island.
These facts make a decidedly favorable showing.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-vii.-conclusion">Chapter VII. Conclusion</h2>
<p>The need of this chapter is hardly apparent, for the author’s
conclusion is as clearly set forth in the beginning as at the close of
the treatise. As to his leading conclusion, the author is not only out
of harmony with the general opinion prevalent among students of the
Negro problem, but is also strangely inconsistent with his former self.
The same author who in 1896, wrote: “It is not in the condition of life,
but in the race traits and tendencies, that we find the cause of
excessive mortality,”<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a> in 1892 affirmed: “The colored
<span class="pagenum"><span id="Page_35">35</span></span>population is
placed at many disadvantages which it cannot very well remove. The
unsanitary condition of their dwellings, their ignorance of the laws of
health, and general poverty are the principal causes of their high
mortality.”<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a> The Frederick L. Hoffman of 1892,
according to the general judgment, is much nearer the true analysis than
the Frederick L. Hoffman of 1896.</p>
<p>The author’s conclusion will not stand the philosophical tests of a
sound theory.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It is based upon disputed data. The accuracy of the eleventh
census is not acceptable either to the popular or the scientific
mind.</p></li>
<li><p>It is not based upon a sufficient induction of data. The
arguments at most apply to the Negroes in the large cities, who
constitute less than 12 per cent of the total population.</p></li>
<li><p>It does not account for the facts arranged under it as
satisfactorily as can be done under a different hypothesis. The author
fails to consider that the discouraging facts of observation may be due
to the violent upheaval of emancipation and reconstruction, and are,
therefore, only temporary in their duration.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I do not know whether the author believes in Providence as a
determining factor in society or not. It may not be accounted scientific
to take cognizance of any element which cannot be quantified, counted,
weighed, or measured. But I do know that the wisest of our species have
always believed that God is the controlling factor in human affairs. The
Negro’s hopes and aspirations are built upon the foundation of this
belief. We are told in His word that he visits the sins of the fathers
upon the children unto the third and fourth generation. If the Negro,
then, will conform his life to the moral and sanitary laws, may not the
evil tendencies now observable be eradicated or overcome? The first
effects of emancipation are always harmful to the moral and physical
well-being of the liberated class. The removal of physical restraints,
before moral restraints have grown strong enough to take their place,
must always result in misconduct. The Jews in Egypt labored under
circumstances remarkably similar to those of the American Negro. After
their emancipation, it required them forty years to make the progress
which the scientific process would have required them to make in forty
days. Such was their moral and physical degeneracy, that only <span
class="pagenum"><span id="Page_36">36</span></span>two persons of all
the hosts who left the land of Egyptian bondage survived to reach the
Promised Land forty years afterward. Luckily for the Hebrews, there were
no statisticians in those days. Think of the future which an Egyptian
philosopher would have predicted for this people! And yet out of the
loins of this race have sprung the moral and spiritual law-givers of
mankind. We should not be discouraged because the Negro does not make a
bee-line from Egyptian bondage to the Promised Land beyond the Jordan.
He, too, must tarry awhile in the wilderness before he enters upon the
full enjoyment of the heritage of freedom.</p>
<p>To the Negro I would say, let him not be discouraged at the ugly
facts which confront him. The sociologists are flashing the searchlight
of scientific inquiry upon him. His faults lie nearer the surface and
are more easily detected than those of the white race. Let him not be
overwhelmed when all his faults are observed, set in a note book,
learned and conned by rote, to be cast into his teeth. If all the ugly
facts about any people were brought to light they would furnish an
unpleasant record. When the Savior told the woman of Samaria all that
she ever did, a very unsavory career was disclosed. If all the misdeeds
of any people or individual were brought to light, the best of the race
would be injured and the rest would be ruined. The Negro should accept
the facts with becoming humility, and strive to live in closer
conformity with the requirements of human and divine law. He does not
labor under a destiny of death from which there is no escape. It is a
condition and not a theory that confronts him.</p>
