<p><span class="pagenum">144</span> For many years it has been the
custom of certain portions of the Negro group living in Southern cities
to give some form of party when money was needed to supplement the
family income. The purpose for giving such a party was never stated, but
who cared whether the increment was used to pay the next installment on
the “Stineway” piano, or the weekly rent? On the one hand, these parties
were the life of many families of a low economic status who sought to
confine their troubles with a little joy. On the other hand, they were a
wild form of commercialized recreation in its primary stages. Humor was
the counterpart of their irony.</p>
<p>No social standing was necessary to promote these affairs. Neither
was one forced to have a long list of friends. All that the prospective
host required to “throw” such an affair would be a good piano player and
a few girls. Of course you paid an admission fee—usually ten cents—which
was for the benefit of some Ladies Auxiliary—though it may have been an
auxiliary to that particular house. The music invited you, and the
female of the species urged that you remain. The neighborhood girls came
unescorted, but seldom left alone. Dancing was the diversion and there
is no reason to doubt that these affairs were properly named
“SHIN-DIGS.”</p>
<p>There was “Beaver Slide,” that supposedly rough section of the Negro
district, situated in the hollow between two typically Georgian Hills.
Here lived a more naive group of Negroes whose sociables were certain to
make the passers by take notice. The motto for their affairs seemed to
be “Whosoever will let him come, and may the survived survive.” Twenty
to thirty couples packed into two small rooms, “slow-dragging” to the
plaintive blues of the piano player, whose music had a boss
accompaniment furnished by his feet. The piano was opened top and front
that the strains may be more distinct, and that the artist may have the
joy of seeing as well as hearing his deft touches (often played by
“ear”) reflected in the mechanics of the instrument. They were a
free-“joy-unconfined” group. Their conventions were their own. If they
wished to guffaw they did—if they wished to fight they did. But they
chiefly danced— not with the aloofness of a modern giglio hut with
fervor. What a picture they presented! Women in ginghams or cheap
finery, men in peg top trousers, silk shirts, “loud” arm bands, and the
ever present tan shoes with the “bull dog” toe. Feet stamped
merrily—songs sung cheerily—No blues writer can ever record accurately
the tones and words of those songs—they are to be heard and not
written—bodies sweating, struggling in their effort to get the most of
the dance; a drink of “lightning” to accelerate the enthusiasm—floors
creaking and sagging—everybody happy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">145</span> During the dance as well as the
intermission, you bought your refreshments. This was a vital part of the
evening’s enjoyment. But what food you could get for a little money!
Each place had its specialties—“Hoppinjohn,” (rice and black-eyed peas)
or Mulatto rice (rice and tomatoes). Okra gumbo, Sweet potato
pone—sometimes Chicken—Chitterlings—Hog maws—or other strictly southern
dishes. You ate your fill. Dancing was resumed and continued until all
were ready to leave—or it had suddenly ended in a brawl causing the
“Black Maria” to take some to the station house and the police sending
the remaining folk to their respective homes.</p>
<p>And there were those among us who had a reverential respect for such
affairs. At that time there was no great popularity attached to a study
of the Negro in his social environment. These were just plain folks
having a good time. On the other hand, they were capable of description,
and to those of us who knew, they were known as “struggles,”
“break-downs,” “razor-drills,” “flop-wallies” and “chitterling parties.”
These they were in fact as well as fancy. It was a struggle to dance in
those crowded little rooms, while one never knew if the cheaply
constructed flooring would collapse in the midst of its sagging and
creaking. What assurance did one have that the glistening steel of a
razor or “switch blade” would not flash before the evening’s play was
done? And very often chitterlings were served—yet by the time forty
sweating bodies had danced in a small parlor with one window—a summer’s
evening—and continued to dance—well the party still deserved that name.
But Mrs. Bailey paid her rent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>NEWS ITEM: “Growing out of economic stress, this form of
nocturnal diversion has taken root in Harlem—that section known as the
world’s largest Negro centre. Its correct and more dignified name is
“Parlor Social ,” but in the language of the street, it is caustically
referred to as a “house rent party.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the mass movement of Southern Negroes to Northern Cities, came
their little custom. Harlem was astounded. Socially minded individuals
claimed that the H.C.L. with the relative insufficiency of wages was
entirely responsible for this ignominious situation; that the exorbitant
rents paid by the Negro wage earners had given rise to the obnoxious
“house rent party.” The truth seemed to be that the old-party of the
South had attired itself a la Harlem. Within a few years the custom
developed into a business venture whereby a tenant sought to pay a rent
four, five and six times as great as was paid in the South. It developed
by-products both legal and otherwise, hence it became extremely
popular.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">146</span> There has been an evolution in the
éclat of the rent party since it has become “Harlemized.” The people
have seen a new light, and are no longer wont to have it go unnamed.
They called it a “Parlor Social.” That term, however, along with “Rent
Party” is for the spoken word. “Social Whist Party” looks much better in
print and has become the prevailing terminology. Nor is its name
restricted to these. Others include “Social Party,” “Too Terrible
Party,” “Too Bad Party,” “Matinee Party,” “Parlor Social,” “Whist
Party,” and “Social Entertainment.” And, along with the change in
nomenclature has come a change in technique. No longer does the
entrepreneur depend upon the music to welcome his stranger guests; nor
does he simply invite friends of the neighborhood. The rent party ticket
now turns the trick.</p>
<p>There straggles along the cross-town streets of North Harlem a
familiar figure. A middle aged white man, bent from his labor as the
Wayside Printer, is pushing a little cart which has all of the equipment
necessary for setting up the rent party ticket. The familiar tinkle of
his bell in the late afternoon brings the representative of some family
to his side. While you wait, he sets up your invitation with the
bally-ho heading desired, and at a very reasonable price. The grammar
and the English may be far from correct, but they meet all business
requirements since they bring results. What work the Wayside Printer
does not get goes to the nearest print shop; some of which specialize in
these announcements.</p>
<p>A true specimen of the popular mind is expressed in these tickets.
The heading may be an expression from a popular song, a slang phrase, a
theatrical quip or “poetry.” A miscellaneous selection gives us the
following: “Come and Get it Fixed;” “Leaving Me Papa, It’s Hard To Do
Because Mama Done Put That Thing On You;” “If You Can’t Hold Your Man,
Don’t Cry After He’s Gone, Just Find Another;” “Clap Your Hands Here
Comes Charlie and He’s Bringing Your Dinah Too;” “Old Uncle Joe, the
Jelly Roll King is Back in Town and is Shaking That Thing;” “Here I am
Again. Who? Daddy Jelly Roll and His Jazz Hounds;” “It’s Too Bad Jim,
But if You Want To Find a Sweet Georgia Brown, Come to the House of
Mystery;” “You Don’t Get Nothing for Being an Angel Child, So you Might
as Well Get Real Busy and Real Wild.”</p>
<p>And at various parties we find special features, among them being
“Music by the Late Kidd Morgan;” “Music by Kid Professor, the Father of
the Piano;” “Music by Blind Johnny;” “Music by Kid Lippy;” “Skinny At
the Traps;” “Music Galore;” “Charge De Affairs Bessie and Estelle;”
“Here You’ll Hear that Sweet Story That’s Never Been Told;”
“Refreshments to Suit;” “Refreshments by ‘The Cheater’.” All of these
present to the average rent party habitueé a very definite picture of
what is to be expected, as the card is given to him on the street
corner, or at the subway station.</p>
<p>The parties outdo their publicity. There is always more than has been
announced on the public invitation. Though no mention was made of an
admission fee, one usually pays from twenty-five to fifty cents for this
privilege. The refreshments are not always refreshing, but are much the
same as those served in parts of the South, with gin and day-old Scotch
extra. The Father of the Piano lives up to his reputation as he
accompanies a noisy trap drummer, or a select trio composed of fife,
guitar, and saxophone.</p>
<p>Apart from the admission fee and the sale of food, and drinks, the
general tenor of the party is about the same as one would find in a
group of “intellectual liberals” having a good time. Let us look at one.
We arrived a little early—about nine-thirty o’clock. The ten persons
present, were dancing to the strains of the Cotton Club Orchestra via
radio. The drayman was just bringing two dozen chairs from a nearby
undertaker’s establishment, who rents them for such affairs. The hostess
introduced herself, asked our names, and politely informed us that the
“admittance fee” was thirty-five cents, which we paid. We were
introduced to all, the hostess not remembering <span
class="pagenum">147</span> a single name. Ere the formality was over,
the musicians, a piano player, saxophonist, and drummer, had arrived and
immediately the party took on life. We learned that the saxophone player
had been in big time vaudeville; that he could make his instrument
“cry;” that he had quit the stage to play for the parties because he
wanted to stay in New York.</p>
<p>There were more men than women, so a poker game was started in the
next room, with the woman who did not care to dance, dealing. The music
quickened the dancers. They sang “Muddy Water, round my
feet—ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.” One girl remarked—“Now this party’s getting
right.” The hostess informed us of the menu for the evening—Pig feet and
Chili—Sandwiches a la carte, and of course if you were thirsty, there
was some “good stuff” available. Immediately, there was a rush to the
kitchen, where the man of the house served your order.</p>
<p>For the first time we noticed a man who made himself conspicuous by
his watchdog attitude toward all of us. He was the “Home Defense
Officer,” a private detective who was there to forestall any outside
interference, as well as prevent any losses on the inside on account of
the activity of the “Clean-up Men.” There were two clean-up men there
that night and the H.D.O. had to be particularly careful lest they walk
away with two or three fur coats or some of the household furnishings.
Sometimes these men would be getting the “lay” of the apartment for a
subsequent visit.</p>
<p>There was nothing slow about this party. Perfect strangers at nine
o’clock were boon companions at eleven. The bedroom had become the card
room—a game of “skin” was in progress on the floor while dice were
rolled on the bed. There was something “shady” about the dice game, for
one of the players was always having his dice caught. The musicians were
still exhorting to the fifteen or twenty couples that danced. Bedlam
reigned. It stopped for a few minutes while one young man hit another
for getting fresh with his girl while dancing. The H.D.O. soon ended the
fracas.</p>
<p>About two o’clock, a woman from the apartment on the floor below rang
the bell and vociferously demanded that this noise stop or that she
would call an officer. The hostess laughed in her face and slammed the
door. Some tenants are impossible! This was sufficient however, to call
the party to a halt. The spirit—or “spirits” had been dying by degrees.
Everybody was tired—some had “dates”—others were sleepy— while a few
wanted to make a cabaret before “curfew hour.” Mrs. Bailey calmly
surveyed a disarranged apartment, and counted her proceeds.</p>
<p>And so the rent party goes on. In fact, it has been going from bad to
worse. Harlem copyists of Greenwich Village give them now—for the lark
of it. Not always is it a safe and sane affair. Too many evils have
crept in, professional gamblers, confidence men, crooks looking for an
accomplice for the night, threats of fights with revolvers and razors
drawn—any or all of these things may appear in one party. You are seldom
certain of your patrons. However, one entrepreneur is always certain of
her guests. She invites only members of the Street Cleaning Department
and their friends. She extends the invitation Viva Voce from the front
window of her apartment. The occupant in the apartment below her once
complained to the court of the noise in the course of her parties. The
court advised that if the noise were too great she should move. She
remained.</p>
<p>At the same time, there may be tragedies. The <em>New York Age</em>
carried an editorial sometime ago on a “Rent Party Tragedy.” At this
affair one woman killed another woman about a third member of the
species. The editorial states in part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“One of these rent parties a few weeks ago was the scene of a tragic
crime in which one jealous woman cut the throat of another, because the
two were rivals for the affections of a third woman. The whole situation
was on a par with the recent Broadway play, imported from Paris,
although the underworld tragedy took place in this locality,—In the
mean<span class="pagenum">148</span>time, the combination of bad gin,
jealous women, a carving knife, and a rent party is dangerous to the
health of all concerned.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nowadays, no one knows whether or not one is attending a bonafide
rent party. The party today may be fostered by the Tenants Protective
Association, or the Imperial Scale of Itinerant Musicians, or the
Society for the Relief of Ostracized Bootleggers. Yes, all of these
foster parties, though the name is one of fancy. Musicians and
Bootleggers have to live as well as the average tenant, and if they can
combine their efforts on a business proposition, the status of both may
be improved.</p>
<p>It has become in some quarters, a highly commercial affair. With the
increased overhead expenses—printing of tickets, hiring the Home Defense
Officer, renting chairs, hiring the musicians—one has to make the
venture pay.</p>
<p>But the rent parties have not been so frequent of late. Harlem’s new
dance halls with their lavish entertainment, double orchestra, and
“sixteen hours of continuous dancing,” with easy chairs and refreshments
available are ruining the business. They who continue in this venture of
pleasure and business are working on a very close margin both socially
and economically, when one adds the complexity illustrated by the
following incident:</p>
<p>A nine year old boy gazed up from the street to his home on the “top
floor, front, East side” of a tenement on West 134th Street about eleven
thirty on a Friday night. He waited until the music stopped and cried,
“Ma! Ma! I’m sleepy. Can I come in now?” To which a male voice, the
owner of which had thrust his head out of the window, replied,—“Your ma
says to go to the Midnight Show, and she’ll come after you. Here’s four
bits. She says the party’s just got going good.”</p>
