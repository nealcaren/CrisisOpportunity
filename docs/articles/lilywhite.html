<p><span class="pagenum">170</span> In 1881, Jeremiah Grandison, a Negro
worker of Pittsburgh, Pa., told the Federation of Organized Trades and
Labor Unions then meeting in that city, that it would be dangerous for
them to exclude from their membership common laborers in general, and
Negro workers in particular, lest they “in an emergency, be employed in
positions they could readily qualify themselves to fill.” At that time
the skilled craftsman was supreme. Through his union he sought to
protect his skill, which was at a premium, and his craft, which was an
art. The organization of the unskilled worker was considered
ill-advised, for that group then would become dependent upon the skilled
workers in the unions. The unskilled worker was to be considered only
when the skilled ones “were in danger of losing their advantages and
places, due to the unstinted competition of the unskilled.”</p>
<p>The Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions resolved itself
into the American Federation of Labor, which organization attempted to
maintain the same liberal membership policy for Negro workers that was
fostered by the Knights of Labor. For the first nine years of its
existence the pressure of organization routine kept the racial
difficulties in the background. It was not until 1890 that the A.F. of
L. gave specific attention to the problem of color discrimination. In
that year it went on record as looking with disfavor “upon trades unions
having provisions in their constitutions which exclude from membership
persons on account of race or color.” The 1893 convention reaffirmed “as
one of the cardinal principles of the labor movement that the working
people must unite or organize, irrespective of creed, color, sex,
nationality or politics.” In substantiation of this avowed policy labor
leaders cited the fact that the International Association of Machinists
had been refused admission to the Federation because its membership was
limited to white persons. In 1897 the Federation finding it necessary to
refute charges to the effect that trades unions were obstructing the
economic progress of Negroes by refusing them admission to their
organizations, declared that “it welcomes into its ranks all labor
without regard to creed, color, race, sex or nationality, and that its
efforts have been and will continue to be to encourage the organization
of those most needing its protection, whether in the North or South,
East or West, white or black.” When, in 1910, Samuel Gompers was accused
of reading the Negro out of the labor movement, he stated that, “instead
of reading the Negroes out of the labor movement, my contention, and the
contention of the American Federation of Labor is to try to bring them
into the organized labor movement in our own country.”</p>
<p>For forty odd years such declarations as the aforementioned have been
fed to the Negro workers. When the World War ushered in a period of
greater industrial inclusion for Negro workers, representatives of Negro
organizations petitioned the A.F. of L. to “show a more active interest
in the organization of Negro labor.” As a result of this overture, the
1918 convention adopted a resolution to the following effect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is with pleasure we learn that leaders of the colored race realize
the necessity of organizing the workers of that race into unions
affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, and your committee
recommends that the Executive Council give special attention to
organizing the colored wage workers in the future. We wish it
understood, however, that in doing so no fault is or can be found with
the work done in the past, but we believe that with the cooperation of
the leaders of that race much better results can be accomplished.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the Communists called the Negro Labor Congress in Chicago in
October, 1925, the Federation branded the scheme as deceptive and
deserving of the indignation it received. For “It is bad enough to
mislead those who have an equal opportunity to know, but to take
advantage of the weakness of those who have a moral right to our special
care is quite outside the pale of decency and ethics. The A.F. of L.
offers to Negro wage earners as a substitute for the Communist movement
the “protection and the experience of the Trade Union Movement”<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> (as exemplified by the A.F. of
L.).</p>
<p>Though the American Federation of Labor has uttered pronouncement
upon pronouncement favoring the admission of Negro workers, that body
has failed to convince the masses of Negro workers that it is rendering
other than lip service to such expressed policies. For evidence these
workers cite <span class="pagenum">171</span> the fact that twenty-two
national unions, eleven of which are affiliated to the A.F. of L.,
exclude Negroes from their membership through provisions in their
constitutions or rituals.</p>
<h2 id="ii">II</h2>
<p>In addition to the Brotherhood of Dining Car Conductors, the Order of
Railway Conductors of America, the Grand International Brotherhood of
Locomotive Engineers, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and
Enginemen, the Neptune Association, the American Federation of Railroad
Workers, the Brotherhood of Railroad Station Employers and Clerks, the
American Association of Train Dispatchers, the Railroad Yardmasters of
America, the Railroad Yardmasters of North America the following unions
affiliated with the A.F. of L. exclude Negro workers: The International
Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Shipbuilders and Helpers of America,
the International Association of Machinists, the Brotherhood of Railway
Carmen, the Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks, Freight
Handlers, Express and Station Employees, the Order of Sleeping Car
Conductors, the National Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots of
North America, the Switchmen’s Union of North America, the Railway Mail
Association, the American Wire Weavers Protective Association, the Order
of Railway Telegraphers and the Commercial Telegraphers Union of
America. As a result of the exclusion policy of the eleven unions
affiliated to the Federation not less than 225,000 Negro workers are
denied trade union affiliation and its attendant benefits.</p>
<p>Because of the A.F. of L.’s policy that affiliated organizations may
not retain in their constitutions any discriminatory clause or clauses
against the race or color of workers, the Boilermakers and the
Machinists accomplish such an exclusion by a pledge which forms a part
of the ritual, and binds each member to propose only white workmen for
membership. Singularly, the Machinists who were refused membership in
the Federation until 1895 because the constitution made eligible for
membership “white workers” only, were admitted when the same exclusion
was achieved through their ritual. The Negro workers, however, would
have little reason for quarreling with the American Federation of Labor
if that organization did no more than obey the letter of the law. Though
some unions not admitting Negro workers have jurisdiction over fields in
which few or no Negroes are employed—as the Dining Car Conductors—that
exclusion serves to prevent Negro employment in that field.
Unfortunately the A.F. of L. has not played fair with itself in this
respect, to wit: the cases of the Machinists, the Boilermakers, the
Railway Clerks and the Railway Mail Association.</p>
<p>In the case of the Railway and Steamship Clerks, the Federation (1)
permitted the union to remain a member and exclude Negro workers (2)
organized the excluded workers into local unions subject to the A.F. of
L. (3) failed to validate its ruling on discriminatory clauses by
permitting the Railway Clerks to retain its affiliation to the A.F. of
L. (4) suspended the union because it failed to obey a ruling of the
Federation on a jurisdictional dispute arising with the Teamsters’ Union
(5) permitted the union to reaffiliate upon satisfactory settlement of
this dispute without having the clause “all white persons” removed from
the constitution.</p>
<p>About fifteen years ago the Railway Mail Association was reported to
have two hundred Negro members who were railway postal employees. While
a member of the A.F. of L. this body amended its constitution so as to
exclude Negroes from membership because “statistics indicate that
certain groups of society are a greater risk than other groups. Being
chartered as a fraternal organization it was inconsistent for the
Association to attempt to carry any group of workers at the expense of
others, and this thought possibly had a great deal to do with the
amending of the constitution as it was amended.” The only Negro members
of the Association today are the “hangovers” from the early days.</p>
<p>The American Federation of Labor condones other discriminatory
practices affecting Negro workers. The Railway Carmen, for example,
limits its membership to “any white person between the ages of 16 and 65
years.” In 1921 the Carmen, without changing the aforementioned
restriction made a special ruling covering 500 Negro workers employed on
railroads in the South. The constitutional amendment on this matter
reading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On railroads where the employment of colored persons has become a
permanent institution they shall be admitted to membership in separate
lodges. Where these lodges of Negroes are organized they shall be under
the jurisdiction of the nearest white local, and shall be represented in
any meeting of the Joint Protective Board Federation, meetings or
conventions where delegates may be seated, by white men.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No more definite example of the restriction of free labor is extant
than that fostered by the International Brotherhood of Blacksmiths, Drop
Forgers and Helpers, affiliated to the A.F. of L. When the Blacksmiths
were forced to organize the Negro workers because of the great inroads
that group was making into the organized field, the following
constitutional qualifications were established:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where there are a sufficient number of colored helpers they may be
organized as an auxiliary local and shall be under the jurisdiction of
the white local having jurisdiction over that territory. Colored helpers
shall not transfer except to another auxiliary local composed of colored
members, and <em>colored members shall not be promoted to blacksmiths or
helper apprentices and will not be admitted to shops where white workers
are now employed.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the objects of the Brotherhood of Blacksmiths is “to
perpetuate our association on the basis of friendship and justice.” What
a satisfying creed for 10,000 Negro workers employed in the trades over
which this union has jurisdiction!</p>
<p>The analysis may be carried on to include the Brotherhood of
Maintenace of Way Employees, with 10,000 Negro members, all of whom are
en<span class="pagenum">172</span>titled to “all of the benefits and
protection guaranteed by the constitution,” but not one of whom may
represent his lodge in the grand lodge. That privilege is for white men,
who shall be selected by their colored brethren. Or, the analysis may
include the International Association of Sheet Metal Workers who
organize Negro sheet metal workers into segregated unions from which
they may not transfer except to another segregated union; or the Hotel
and Restaurant Employees who provide in Section 20 of their
constitution, that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a colored worker at our craft shall desire to enter a local in a
city where only a white local exists, he may be accepted in the
International Union as a member-at-large, provided he possesses the
necessary qualifications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or, the National Federation of Rural Letter Carriers who, while
accepting Negro members in some states permit only white members to
serve as delegates to conventions, and as office holders; or, the Flint
Glass Workers who object to Negro workers universally because “the pipes
on which glass is blown pass from one man’s mouth to another”; or, the
Journeymen Plumbers and the Electrical Workers, who, though not
restricting membership to white workers by law are generally understood
not to admit Negroes. As early as 1903 the editor of <em>The Electrical
Worker</em> wrote “We do not want the Negro in the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, but we think that they should be
organized in locals of their own, affiliated to the American Federation
of Labor as that organization knows no creed or color.”<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="iii">III</h2>
<p>The suggestion of the Electrical Workers that Negroes join local
unions affiliated to the A.F. of L. illustrated the effect of the
measure adopted by the 1902 convention of the Federation whereby
separate units of Negro workers might be organized by that body. It was
in 1900 that President Gompers suggested that these separate locals be
organized. Realizing that some remedial action had to be taken in the
situation produced when thousands of Negro workers were denied union
affiliation, the 1902 convention amended the Constitution of the A.F. of
L. as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Separate charters may be issued to Central Labor Unions, Local
Unions, or Federal Labor Unions composed exclusively of colored members,
where, in the judgment of the Executive Council, it appears advisable
and to the best interests of the Trade Union Movement to do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By such action the Federation not only recognized the legality of
excluding Negroes from organized bodies, but accepted “James Crow” as a
full-fledged member of the American Federation of Labor. If the labor
leaders of that day had not totally misread the trends in American
industrial life, it is doubtful that they would have attempted giving
such permanency to the institution of Negro local and federal unions.
They, the labor leaders, undoubtedly felt that such an organization was
better than no organization. The Negro workers, on the other hand, found
that being directly affiliated to the A.F. of L. through the local
unions was, in many instances, as good as having no organization at all.
Why? Because, instead of removing barriers from the path of Negro
workers, it perpetuated an existing one—biracialism; because, it
established a dual system of federation and because the Negro local
tended to create for the Negro worker a bargaining power wreaker than
that of the white worker. With what results? The secretary of Local
Union No. 17786 states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We do not get the same rights as the white help do in no way. Of
course we get 14 days off in the summer months without pay and the
whites get it off with pay—14 days. But we pay just as much dues as they
do and do more work for the company. We are only getting $3.12 a day for
8 hours, no time and half for overtime.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no doubt that the A.F. of L. enjoyed a measure of success in
organizing Negro workers through the medium of local unions until 1923.
In December, 1911, there wrere 11 Negro local and federal unions with
309 members affiliated to that body. In 1919, the number of locals had
increased to 169. In 1929 there were 21 locals. In 1911 there were three
salaried Negro workers employed as organizers; in 1929 there was none.
When the National Urban League broached the question of Negro organizers
to the Executive Council of the Federation in 1926, that body decided
that it was impossible to add a Negro organizer at that time, despite
the fact that outside sources were willing to pay half of the salary of
such a person. The relative and absolute decline of Negro local unions
is shown in the following table:</p>

<p>Thus, the one instrument ordained to foster the organization of Negro
labor, the Negro local, has shown itself to be incompetent in meeting
the situation. Because it lacked a system of control and supervision the
Negro local has failed to keep the Negro worker organized on the one
hand, and has been negligent in fostering his inclusion in national
unions on the other. Furthermore, it has shown that same gap between the
Federation’s policy and practice, for, despite the fact that each member
of a local trade or federal labor union is required to take an
obligation to the effect that,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am to be respectful in work and action to every woman, to be
considerate to the widows and orphans, the weak and the defenseless, and
never to discriminate against a fellow worker on account of creed, color
or nationality,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>there are local trade and federal labor unions that unhesitatingly
state a violation of that part of the obligation, pertaining to color
discrimination. Local No. 10167 of Baggage Messengers does not admit
Negro workers on account of its “business transactions with the public,
does not regard the organization of Negro workers as essential to the
success of the labor movement in its case, and makes no effort to secure
Negro membership.”</p>
<h2 id="iv">IV</h2>
<p>What then is the official policy of the American Federation of Labor
toward the organizing of Negro workers? It consists of a number of
resolutions urging that Negro workers be organized ; generous
declarations to the effect that workers should be organic without regard
to race, creed or color; protests here, and vacuous decrees there
against the organizing efforts of left-wing groups; the segregated
organization of Negro workers in certain occupations through local trade
and federal labor unions; a few organizing campaigns that died aborning;
the employment, at various times, of a few Negro organizers, and a total
inability, if not unwillingness, to compel the member International
unions to remove from their constitutions Negro exclusion clauses or
have their charters revoked.</p>
<p>The A.F. of L. essays certain policies, “stands for” them, realizing
they are not being made effective. It has attempted to live up to a
philosophy of liberalism without performing the mechanics necessary to
make that liberalism a reality. So void and few have been the A.F. of
L.’s efforts in behalf of Negro workers, despite its pronouncements,
that it has failed to crystallize the opinion of Negro and white
workers, and the public to any other effect than that the American
Federation of Labor “stands for” the organization of workers, despite
their race, creed or color-, then, with complacent self-satisfaction
sits down, having done actually nothing. In fact, the American
Federation <span class="pagenum">189</span>of Labor, because of its
hands-off policy in the early nineties, because of its failure to
maintain the organization of the thousands of Negro workers organized in
local trade and federal labor unions from 1917-1922, and despite its
Negro membership of 61,032 workers belonging to national unions
affiliated to the A.F. of L., has less positive power and influence
among Negro workers than at any other time in the last thirty years.</p>
<p>When the Negro worker faces his problems of affiliation to organized
labor he expects to find a champion in the A.F. of L. This worker knows
that such limitations so far as his being organized is concerned are
secondary considerations. The prime factor is that his employment
opportunities are restricted to a greater degree, because he is
excluded. Therefore, when the American Federation of Labor condones
practices similar to the above mentioned, and sugarcoats these practices
with its palaver about all workers being organized despite race, etc.,
etc., etc.,—meanwhile skilfully evading or bluntly ignoring the plaints
of the Negro group</p>
