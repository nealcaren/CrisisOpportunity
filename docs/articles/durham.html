<p><span class="pagenum">333</span>Durham offers none of the color and
creative life we find among Negroes in New York City. It is a city of
fine homes, exquisite churches, and middle class respectability. It is
not the place where men write and dream; but a place where black men
calculate and work. No longer can men say that the Negro is lazy and
shiftless and a consumer. He has gone to work. He is a producer. He is
respectable. He has a middle class.</p>
<p>Many who have been interested in the Negro’s progress, and especially
his critics, have bemoaned the fact that the Negro has had no middle
class. Negro society has been divided chiefly into the professional and
the working classes. The working class has not consisted of skilled
artisans but unskilled laborers and domestic servants. While the
professional class has imitated many of the traits of the white middle
class, they have regarded themselves as essentially an aristocracy. The
working classes have been execrated by both white and colored for their
love of pleasure. So in neither of these classes have the Negroes
developed a middle class economic outlook. We can discount the fanciful
schemes for getting rich and the activities of the swindler. Even small
retail stores operated by Negroes are conspicuously absent from Negro
communities. But the Negro is at last developing a middle class, and its
main center is in Durham. As we read the lives of the men in Durham who
have established the enterprises there, we find stories parallelling the
most amazing accounts of the building of American fortunes. We find them
beginning their careers without much formal education and practising the
old-fashioned virtues of the old middle class. Their lives are as free
from the Negro’s native love of leisure and enjoyment of life <span
class="pagenum">334</span>as Franklin’s life. Hard work was their rule.
We see them assuming the rôle of promoter and organizer. And finally we
find them in the rôle of the modern business man. Consequently, we have
in Durham to-day the outstanding group of colored capitalists who have
entered the second generation of business enterprise. This is
significant, as few Negro enterprises have survived the personal
direction and energy of the founders. Moreover, these men have mastered
the technique of modern business and acquired the spirit of modern
enterprise.</p>
<p>When we trace the history of this development we must begin with the
late John Merrick. He was born a slave in 1859 in Sampson County, North
Carolina. His early years were spent at work in a brickyard in Chapel
Hill. He learned to read and write from the Bible. As he was compelled
to support his mother and younger brother, he could not attend school.
Although he could not share in the educational advantages which Northern
missionaries were offering Negroes during the Reconstruction, he helped
as a brickmason to build one of their leading schools, Shaw University
in Raleigh. Next we find Mr. Merrick a bootblack and later a barber in
the same shop. Full of energy and enterprise, he set out with his wife
to work in a new barber shop in Durham, where he was to make his
distinguished career. It is a significant fact that Mr. Merrick came to
Durham at the time when white men were beginning to devote themselves to
the exploitation of the wealth of the South. Of more fundamental
influence upon them was the contact with the leading business men such
as the Dukes, who were his customers. His biographer, T. McCants
Andrews, remarks: “Mr. Merrick’s contact with the leading business men
of Durham had as much to do with his success as his own personal gifts.”
We soon find Mr. Merrick the sole proprietor of the barber shop in which
he worked and the owner of his home. The story of the organization and
the development of the Royal Knights of King David shows that Mr.
Merrick possessed the organizing ability and the spirit of the promoter.
When an itinerant Baptist preacher from Georgia offered to sell the
ritualistic rights to a group of Durham Negroes, Mr. Merrick was <span
class="pagenum">335</span>chief among those to buy the entire order. Nor
was he satisfied with the usual fraternal features, for he soon made it
known that he would not have anything to do with it if it were not a
business proposition. Merrick declared: “Well, I ain’t no society man.”
By shrewd advertisement of the payment of death dues the order grew. A
few years later, Mr. William Pearson, one of the leading men in the
present Durham group, became the guiding spirit in the order. When he
took charge, the collections amounted to fourteen dollars a month. Under
his skill and management, the order, which is essentially an insurance
company, has grown until it numbers 21,000 members in eight states.</p>
<p>We come now to the greatest achievement of the Durham group and no
doubt the greatest monument to Negroes’ business enterprise in
America—the North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company. The first
organization of this company in 1898 consisted of seven men who paid in
fifty dollars each to meet immediate expenses. At first the enterprise
did not flourish and some became discouraged. It was then that
Mr. Merrick and Dr. Moore bought in the interests of the others and,
with the present president, Mr. Spaulding, brought the company to its
present development. Space in Dr. Moore’s office was rented for the work
of the company, which was then known as the North Carolina Mutual and
Provident Association. Mr. Merrick took charge of the financial
direction; Dr. Moore became medical examiner; and Mr. Spaulding,
promoter. The payment of the first death claim of forty dollars caused
such a crisis that the promoters had to call a meeting and pay part of
the sum from their own pockets. This was heralded abroad. By 1905 it was
able to pay salaries after erecting an $8,000 office building in 1904.
At this time another man, Mr. John Avery, became associated with the
company. He is another example of those Americans who have begun their
careers as poor farm boys and in a generation found themselves in
managerial chairs of million dollar enterprises. Mr. Avery is now the
secretary of this company, having an annual income of over two million
dollars.</p>
<p>The growth of the company has been continuous and well <span
class="pagenum">336</span>founded. It has grown from a collection of
$840 in 1899 to over $5,000 a day. It is now operating in eleven states
and the District of Columbia, and has over 1,500 employees. In 1914 the
company began issuing ordinary policies based upon the American
Experience Table of Mortality. In 1919 it became mutualized. To-day it
has $42,000,000 of insurance in force and assets amounting to over
$2,000,000. The company’s office building is one of the ornaments of
Durham’s business district. In this building there is another enterprise
of this group—the Mechanics and Farmers Bank, established in 1908. It
handles the bulk of the business of the insurance company and has
deposits amounting to $612,700. Its resources amount to $800,000. In
1920 this institution saved more than 500 homes and farms being bought
by Negroes by lending the purchasers over $200,000. A branch has been
established in Raleigh.</p>
<p>True to the spirit and habits of modern business men, these men have
undertaken other forms of enterprises wherever an opportunity to promote
some form of productive enterprise appeared. We can count among their
projects two drug stores and a real estate firm. A venture into
industrial exploitation was the only unsuccessful enterprise of these
men. The textile mill which they organized in 1914 was discontinued a
year later, fortunately, without loss, because of the lack of technical
assistance and the European war. One of the more recent undertakings of
this group is the Bankers Fire Insurance Company, which was organized in
1920. This company is now operating in five states and the District of
Columbia. After the merger with another concern, this company had over
$200,- 000 in paid in capital. Its strength was demonstrated in 1922
when it paid out $38,000 in the fire in New Bern. The assets of this
company amount to $350,000.</p>
<p>The latest project to locate in this prolific center of Negro
enterprise is the National Negro Finance Corporation with Dr. Moton as
president and Mr. C. C. Spaulding as vice-president. Its purpose is to
furnish working capital for individuals, firms and corporations. This
corporation hopes by this means to foster the financial and commercial
development of Negroes. <span class="pagenum">337</span>It is
co-operating with the National Negro Business League. As this enterprise
was only begun in 1924, it is too soon to estimate its contribution to
the development of the middle class economic outlook among Negroes, but
it promises a new era in the development of Negro business
enterprise.</p>
<p>In interpreting the advent of the new middle class in Negro life, it
will be interesting to cast a glance at the educational influences
responsible. The men responsible for this phenomenal development in
Negro business did not in the majority of instances come up from the
uneducated ranks. In the case of Mr. Merrick, we have, it is true, the
same story of most Americans who without education have built fortunes
in the last century. But Mr. Spaulding was more fortunate. He had a high
school education. Probably a more important part of his education for
business was his experience as manager of a grocery store. Many have
brought the charge against the so-called higher education that it was
impractical and did not prepare Negroes for life, for practical success.
Yet the promoters of these concerns were for the most part men who had
received education in the schools of higher education. Avery, Pearson,
and Moore were all from such schools. A factor that must not be
overlooked in considering the preparation of the Negro for economic
activities, is that Negroes scarcely ever have an opportunity for
apprenticeship in business concerns, which is the most valuable form of
business education. Consequently it was necessary for men with a larger
education who understood the mechanism of credit to establish such
businesses as we are considering. They had acquired the true spirit of
the modern promoter and a knowledge of his methods. Young Negroes
leaving colleges to-day who would ordinarily enter some business
institution and work their way up, go to schools to acquire business
technique. When a young Negro says he is going into business, he is
usually one who has acquired a college education and intends after a
business course to get a managerial position. He has little faith in the
acquisition of wealth by thrift and the sweat of his brow. Thus we see
the colored middle class growing not out of shopkeepers, but from men
who have a larger outlook.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">338</span>With the establishment of a number of
Negro enterprises, however, it will be possible for some to find
education by apprenticeship. Even here most of them are men of broad
education such as will give them an appreciation and understanding of
the business. The Durham businesses have begun their second generation.
Mr. Edward Merrick, the son of the most distinguished member of the
pioneer group, is the treasurer of the insurance company. He came to the
work with a good education and learned the business from the bottom. He
entered the business just as the second generation in white businesses
enter their fathers’ business. This younger generation is building upon
the firm foundation of the work of the first generation. They are not
dreamers attempting to create Negro business out of nothing. It is well
to mention here the recent failure in Atlanta. The attempt to establish
big business there began in an enterprise—the Standard Life—that was
sound in principle. The failure came when the promoters resorted to the
practices of the magician and the schemes of speculators. Although the
Atlanta group, especially the young men, did not have the business
experience of the Durham group, the failure was not due to the young men
with technical training but to the older men.</p>
<p>These younger men are truly modern business men. They have adopted
the technique of modern business and are saturated with the psychology
of the capitalist class. They work hard, not because of necessity, but
to expand their businesses and invade new fields. They have the same
outlook on life as the middle class everywhere. They support the same
theories of government and morality. They have little sympathy with
waste of time. Their pleasures are the pleasures of the tired business
man who does not know how to enjoy life. They are distinguished laymen
in the churches. They endow charities and schools. Middle class
respectability is their ideal. Above all they want progress. Like modern
business men who have one economy for business and one for private
consumption, they maintain fine homes and expensive cars. They spend
their vacations in the same manner as the whites at Newport.</p>
<p>In this account of the rise of the black middle class, we have <span
class="pagenum">339</span>said nothing of its relation to the white
world. The founders of these enterprises grew up with the exploitation
of the New South. Had it not been for the bar of color some of them
would have been counted among the most conspicuous of the new industrial
and commercial classes in the South. They were restricted in the field
of their activities. Yet they are as typical of the New South as any
white business man. Their outlook is the same. John Merrick in a letter
commenting on the Wilmington riots enunciated views on government held
by the middle class everywhere. Have the men of the white South
recognized these brothers under the skin? Yes. They show respect for
their achievements. They have been friendly to their enterprises. This
is perhaps due to two causes: namely, the lack to a large extent of the
savage race prejudice of the lower South and the absence of serious
competition. White men have recognized these men as the supporters of
property rights. They know these men would no more vote for Debs than
they. Yet, there are still Jim Crow cars in North Carolina, and the
Negro is denied civil and political rights.</p>
<p>Durham is promise of a transformed Negro. The Negro has been a
strange mixture of the peasant and the gentleman in his outlook on life.
Because of the Negro’s love of leisure and sensuous enjoyment, men have
called him lazy and immoral. Because he lacks calculation, white folk
have called him shiftless. But two hundred and fifty years of enforced
labor, with no incentive in its just rewards, more than any inherent
traits, explain why the Negro has for so long been concerned chiefly
with consumption rather than production. Peasant virtues are
middle-class faults. And so are the gentleman’s; and the Negro has come
by these in curious but inevitable ways. Some he has absorbed from the
master-class of the South that he served and knew so intimately; the
rest has come from his artistic nature. The drab way of life that seeks
ever to work and pile up wealth and finds its enjoyment in spasmodic
intoxications of pleasure has not been the way of the Negro. His desire
for color and form has been the cause of mockery. His desire to work for
only enough to supply his wants is only the ideal that has motivated
economic activities in former ages. <span
class="pagenum">340</span>Moreover, love of leisure and interest in
consumption are aristocratic virtues. But to-day, the Negro has his
middle class, and with it his middle-class psychology. More and more
certain elements of the race are absorbing the typical spirit and push
of modern industrialism in America; in the composite portrait of the New
Negro must be put the sharp and forceful features of the Negro man of
business. Through his effort and success, the Negro is becoming an
integral part of the business life of America, and is sharing
particularly in the economic development of the New South, which is
perhaps the outstanding economic consequence of the World War on
America.</p>
