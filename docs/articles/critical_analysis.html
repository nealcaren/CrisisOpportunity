<p><span class="pagenum">308</span> J. S. Mill in his fine treatise on
<em>Representative Government</em> expressed the belief that it is
virtually impossible to build up a democracy out of the intermingling of
racially differentiated groups of men. It may be that historical
experience has indicated the error of Mill’s thesis insofar as different
“racial” groups among the white peoples of the world are concerned, but
there is apparently much evidence to substantiate it when related to the
intermixture of white and black populations in the same society.
Throughout the world today, wherever whites and blacks are present in
any significant numbers in the same community, democracy becomes the
tool of the dominant elements in the white population in their ruthless
determination to keep the blacks suppressed. This is true, whether the
blacks constitute the overwhelming majority of the population, as in
South Africa and Algeria, or the minority, as in the United States.</p>
<p>The responsibility, however, rests not with the institution of
democracy, per se, nor in the readily accepted belief that black and
white simply cannot mix amicably on a common political and economic
basis. Recent world history points out too clearly that modern
democracy, conceived in the womb of middle-class revolutions, was early
put out to work in support of those ruling middle-class interests of
capitalistic society which fathered it. It has remained their loyal
child and has rendered profitable service for them. But when in modern
European countries it came to be vigorously wooed by those mass
interests of society whose lot under modern industrialism has been that
of cruel oppression, democracy was quickly discredited and disowned, and
fascism became the favored child of Big-Business-controlled governments.
The significant fact is that democracy, while never offered in any large
measure to the black populations of the world, has been extended to the
great masses of the working-class population only so long as it was
employed by them as a harmless device involving no real threat to the
increasing control of the society by the ruling classes.</p>
<p>Minority populations, and particularly racial minorities, striving to
exist in any theoretically democratic modern society, are compelled to
struggle strenuously for even a moderate participation in the democratic
game. Minority groups are always with us. They may be national
minorities, i.e., distinct ethnic groups with an individual national and
cultural character living within a state which is dominated by some
other nationality, as in German and Polish Upper Silesia; or they may
come under the looser definition of minorities em<span
class="pagenum">309</span>ployed by the League of Nations, including any
people in any state differing from the majority population in either
race, language or religion, such as the Negro in the United States. But
whatever the nature of the minority group, its special problems may
always be translated in terms of political, economic, and social
disadvantages. Group antagonisms develop, which are fed by mythical
beliefs and attitudes of scorn, derision, hate and discrimination. These
serve as effective social barriers and fix the social, and hence, the
political and economic status of the minority population, The mental
images or verbal characterizations generally accepted as descriptive of
the members of the particular racial group,—the “pictures in our heads”
so aptly discussed by Walter Lippmann,—give rise to stereotypes which
are of the greatest significance in race relations. <a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
These race distinctions, along with similar class and caste
distinctions, are so thoroughly rooted in our social consciousness as to
command serious attention in any consideration of programs whose
objective is equitable treatment for minority racial groups.</p>
<p>Many are the non-scientific solutions for the problem of black-white
race relations that have been offered. Racial equality and tolerance
have been pled for far and wide. But these solutions ignore the
seemingly basic fact that whenever two groups of peoples in daily
contact with each other, and having readily identifiable cultural or
racial differentiations, are likewise forced into economic competition,
group antagonisms must inevitably prevail.</p>
<h2 id="the-negro-as-a-minority-group-in-the-u.s.">The Negro as a
Minority Group in the U.S.</h2>
<p>The Negro group in the United States is characterized by the
conditions of easy racial identification and severe economic competition
with the dominant white population. In addition, the position of the
Negro in this country is conditioned by the historical fact of his
ancestral slavery. All of the present-day relations between the
disadvantaged Negro group and the majority white group are influenced by
this master-slave heritage, and the traditional competition between
poor-white and Negro masses. The stamp of racial and social inferiority
placed upon the Negro, the detached, condescending paternalism of the
“better elements” of the Southern white population, the “missionary”
enterprise of Northern philanthropy, the bitter antipathies between
black and white laboring masses, “Uncle Tomism” in both its cruder and
more polished modern forms, and the inferiority complex of the Negro
group itself, may be directly traced to these historical roots.</p>
<p>The factors of race and the slavery tradition do not fully explain
the perpetuation of the “race problem,” however. Much of what is called
prejudice against the Negro can be explained in economic terms, and in
the peculiar culture of the Southern states, with their large
“poor-white” populations. The determination of the ruling class of large
land-holders in the South to perpetuate in law and custom the doctrine
of the racial inferiority of the Negro was made <span
class="pagenum">310</span> possible only because this numerically
preponderant poor-white population feared the economic competition and
the social and political power of the large black population. The
cultural, political and economic degradation of the Negro also gave the
poor-whites their sole chance for “status.”</p>
<p>Intelligent elements in the white Southern population have in recent
years begun to admit that other factors than mere “race” are involved in
many of the abusive practices employed to intimidate the Negro in the
South. For example, Mr. Arthur Raper, in his excellent study, <em>The
Tragedy of Lynching</em>, explains that the bases of the lynching of
Negroes in the South reside in the determination of the white South to
exploit the Negro, culturally, politically and economically. Such
“social pressures,” as he calls them, are exemplified, for instance,
when a planter assures the outsider that the propertyless Negroes in his
community are wholly satisfied with their small pay, their one-teacher
schools and plantation-unit churches, and their chronic economic and
political dependency. “The query”, writes Raper, “but are they really
satisfied?”, is answered quickly and firmly: “Well, if they’re not
they’d better be!” <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> In other words the large white
land-holding and industrial groups in the South are determined to keep
the Negro in a servile condition and as a profitable and almost
indispensable labor supply. In so doing, black workers have been aligned
against white, from slavery days on, and bitter antagonisms have
developed between these groups. The resulting “racial” situation has not
been in any sense disadvantageous to the employing class, which is not
insensitive to the merits of the policy of <em>divide et impera</em> in
labor-employer relationships.</p>
<p>In reality the Negro population in the United States is a minority
group only in the narrowly racial sense. In every other respect it is
subject to the same divisive influences impinging upon the life of every
other group in the nation. Economically, the Negro, in the vast
majority, is identified with the peasant and proletarian classes of the
country, which are certainly not in the minority. Politically, the
Negro, until recent years under the spell of the “Lincolnian Legend,”
was almost completely identified with the Republican Party. He was
aligned, therefore, with what constituted with monotonous regularity the
majority political group. The Negro thus has been subjected to the same
sectional, political and economic forces which have influenced the white
population, with admitted additional aggravation due solely to the race
equation.</p>
<p>Negro leadership, however, has traditionally put its stress on the
element of race; it has attributed the plight of the Negro to a peculiar
racial condition. Leaders and organizations alike have had but one end
in view— the elimination of “discrimination against the race.” This
attitude has been reflected in the tactics which they have employed to
correct abuses suffered by their group. They have not realized that so
long as this basic conflict in the economic interests of the white and
black groups persists, and it is a perfectly natural phenomenon in a
modern industrial society, neither prayer, nor logic, nor emotional
<span class="pagenum">311</span> or legal appeal can make much headway
against the stereotyped racial attitudes and beliefs of the masses of
the dominant population. The significance of this to the programs of the
corrective and reform organizations working on behalf of the group
should be obvious. The most that such organizations can hope to do is to
devote themselves to the correction of the more flagrant specific cases
of abuse, which because of their extreme nature may exceed even a
prejudiced popular approval; and to a campaign of public enlightenment
concerning the merits of the group they represent and the necessity for
the establishment of a general community of interest among all groups in
the population.</p>
<h2 id="objectives-sought-by-minority-groups">Objectives Sought by
Minority Groups</h2>
<p>In general, the objectives which minority groups traditionally
struggle for are those tenets of social justice embraced by
eighteenth-century liberalism, with its democratic creed of liberty,
equality, and fraternity. This liberalism purported to guarantee the
individual’s economic and political freedom. Economic freedom for the
individual assumed his right to the protection of the state in the
acquisition and use of his property for his private benefit and profit.
In fact, however, democratic liberalism did little to create those
conditions which would facilitate the acquisition of property by any
great numbers of the society. To the contrary, its principles were
applied in countries whose economic structures were so ordered that the
great masses of the populations were presupposed to be
non-property-holding workingmen, whose opportunities for obtaining
property became progressively less easy, and whose economic status was
increasingly less certain as a result of technological and financial
developments within the economic structure,—resulting in periodic
unemployment, loss of income and dissipation of meager savings. In the
United States the presence of the frontier, with the free land it
offered and its rich natural resources, vitalized the American Dream
that every energetic and thrifty American could win economic
independence. The American frontier, however, was never widely open to
the Negro population, and this was one of the factors that forestalled
the development of class stratification, and a consciousness of it, in
the Negro population to the same degree as found in the white.</p>
<p>Political freedom for the individual assumed his right to equality
before the law, the right to freedom of speech, press, religion,
assemblage and movement, and to democratic participation in the
government through the unabridged use of the ballot.</p>
<h2 id="tactics-of-minority-groups">Tactics of Minority Groups</h2>
<p>On this assumption that members of minority groups, like those of the
majority populations in democratic countries, possess certain
inalienable rights,—political, social and economic,—which they must
struggle to preserve, leaders and organizations of minority groups map
out programs and techniques of action designed to protect their people.
Roughly, and rather arbitrarily, the tactics which such groups
ordinarily employ in this struggle can be summarised as follows:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">312</span> 1. <em>Violent</em> a. Direct
rebellion and secession by force. b. Cooperation with other dissentient
elements toward immediate or ultimate revolution. 2.
<em>Non-Violent</em> a. Zionism and Garveyism, involving migration to
new and foreign soil. b. Economic, including passive resistance (the
Gandhi movement) and economic separatism. c. Conciliation, including
interracial organizations. d. Political, including a determined fight
for the ballot and justice through laws, lobbying, picketing, mass
demonstrations and the courts.</p>
<p>While each of these methods has been employed at one time or another
by some minority group, those listed under the non-violent heading have
been the tactics most seriously advocated by American Negro leadership
in its efforts to free the group from political and economic
inequality.</p>
<h2 id="violent-tactics">Violent Tactics</h2>
<p>Numerically, the American Negro is so overwhelmed by the white
population, and in addition the members of the group are so scattered
throughout this vast country, that serious consideration need not be
afforded the tactic of direct secession and rebellion by force.
Likewise, the Negro masses are so lacking in radical class
consciousness; they are so conservative and deeply imbued with a peasant
psychology and the lingering illusion of the American Dream, that any
possibility of large-scale identification of the Negro population with
revolutionary groups can be projected only in the future. The Communist
Party has seriously proselyted among the Negro group but with only
indifferent success. The immediate task of such movements in this
country is to develop radical class-consciousness among the
working-class masses of both white and Negro populations, with a view to
the ultimate recognition of an identity of interest and consequent black
and white solidarity in a militant labor movement.</p>
<h2 id="non-violent-tactics">Non-Violent Tactics</h2>
<p><em>Racial Separatism.</em>—Because of the seeming hopelessness of
the fight to win equal rights for many minority racial groups, some of
the leadership of such groups has often espoused a “defeatist”
philosophy, which takes the form of racial separatism. This defeatism in
its most extreme form follows the general design of the Zionist
movement. For the American Negro the Garvey program may be characterized
as the black counterpart of the Zionist movement. Thousands of American
Negroes came to believe that the racial barriers to equality in this
country could never be surmounted, and they flocked to the support of
the Garvey “back-to-Africa” movement which flourished after the last
war. Like all programs of this character, Garveyism offered the Negro an
emotional escape from oppressive conditions. Also like other such
programs it was impractical, for attractive land for such venture was no
longer available, due to the consuming greed and the inexorable demands
of imperialist nations. The Garvey movement could offer only Liberia to
the American Negro,—one of the most backward and unhealthy <span
class="pagenum">313</span> territories of an altogether uninviting West
Africa. Moreover, the Liberians themselves did not want the American
Negroes.</p>
<p><em>Economic Passive Resistance</em>.—There are many variations of
the non-violent economic tactics, but the most significant are those
which advocate economic passive resistance and economic separatism.
Supporters of economic passive resistance usually look to Gandhi for
their guidance. They see powerful weapons available to the oppressed
group in the employment of the economic boycott and in fearless
self-sacrifice. Through such tactics they propose to wring economic and
political justice from the dominant group by striking at its most
sensitive spot, its markets, and by shaming its Christian conscience. In
the first place, the Gandhi movement has not succeeded in India, despite
the fact that it was attempted in the one country offering it its
greatest possibilities of success. The natives of India are
overwhelmingly preponderant in the population and are capable of
self-immolation on behalf of a cause to a degree unknown to Western
peoples. Moreover, their country is not industrialized and their low
standard of living is such that it cannot be materially affected by the
inevitable reprisals of the controlling groups. Even so, however, the
movement could not break down the military and financial buttresses of
the relative handful of Englishmen allied with the native ruling
interests which control the country.</p>
<p>In a highly industrialized country the possibilities from the
employment of this method of resistance are much less. It means, of
necessity, that the members of the group in the mass must be willing at
the outset to accept an even lower standard of living than that which
they already enjoy. But more important still is the fact that it is
unlikely that any such movement could long withstand the unyielding and
inevitable resistance which would be launched against it by the business
rulers of the country. Presumably, in industrial societies this tactic
would involve the organization of group cooperatives for the production
of industrial and agricultural products. As soon as such a movement
assumed threatening proportions, it would be obliged to withstand severe
counterboycotts which would deprive the members of the group of many
necessary commodities which they could not produce themselves. Moreover,
they would be denied essential credit and capital. The legal and police
forces of the state would inevitably be aligned against them, and, in
addition, they would be subjected to the characteristic gangster attacks
which have recently proved so helpful to employers in labor
disputes.</p>
<p>A mild version of this form of economic passive resistance has been
from time to time advocated by Negro leaders in this country as one
means of obtaining economic justice under the existing system.
Particularly during the depression has this doctrine gained circulation
in the guise of the “don’t-buy-where-you-can’t-work” movement. The
fallacy of this method is obviously discovered in its assumption that it
can offer any real relief to the great masses of Negroes. Its outlook is
narrowly racial, and it fails to realize that it can create no new jobs
but that it can only gain <span class="pagenum">314</span> jobs for
Negroes by displacement of whites. Since there is already a woefully
inadequate number of jobs, whenever a Negro is thus forced into a job in
a Negro community a white man is forced out and must seek employment
elsewhere. And, since the Negro communities do not offer sufficient
economic activity to absorb even the number of Negroes now employed,
this can only mean that Negroes employed in white communities are
endangered of losing their jobs in proportion to the success of the
movement. At best, it could create only a vicious cycle of job
displacement. Moreover, the proponents of the doctrine fail to grasp the
fact that the Negro is not out of a job simply because he is a Negro,
but, rather because the economic system finds itself incapable of
affording an adequate number of jobs for all,—in fact, its productive
system is so organized that it must have a marginal labor supply. But
the most serious defect in the rationalization of this tactic is in the
fact that it widens still further the already deplorable gap between the
white and black working-classes of the nation, by boldly placing the
competition for jobs on a strictly racial basis. If the doctrine were
carried out to its logical conclusion, it would necessarily advocate
that Negro workers be organized as a great strike-breaking group.</p>
<p><em>Economic Separatism</em>.—As a result of the highly segregated
life which racial minority groups are often compelled to live, there is
a strong tendency for the doctrine of economic separatism to take root
as a promising palliative for both political and economic oppression.
This has been a particularly virulent creed among American Negroes,
chiefly due to the impetus given the movement by Booker T. Washington
and his successor, Major Moton. Negro businesses are almost entirely the
product of segregation and can be characterized as “defensive
enterprises.” The promise of this hope of constructing an independent
and segregated black economy within the walls of the white capitalist
economy is excellently discussed by Spero and Harris in the following
words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet how such an independent economy is to rise and function when the
white world outside controls credit, basic industry, and the state is
something which the sponsors of the movement prefer to ignore. If such
an economy is to rise it will have to do so with the aid of white
philanthropy and will have to live upon white sufferance. If the great
white banks and insurance companies decide that they want Negro business
it is hard to see how the little black institutions can compete
successfully against them. The same holds for the chain stores and
various retail establishments. They will be able to undersell their
Negro competitors if they want to, and the Negro world will not continue
indefinitely to pay higher prices for its goods merely out of pride of
race. Basic industry will continue to remain in the hands of the white
world, for even the most ardent supporters of an independent black
economy will admit that there is no prospect of the Negro capitalists
amassing enough wealth to establish steel mills, build railroads and
pipe lines, and gain control of essential raw materials.<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Political Tactics: Civil Libertarianism.</em>—Perhaps the
favorite method of struggle for rights employed by minority groups is
the political. Through the use of the ballot and the courts strenuous
efforts are put forth to gain <span class="pagenum">315</span> social
justice for the group. Extreme faith is placed in the ability of these
instruments of democratic government to free the minority from social
proscription and civic inequality. The inherent fallacy of this belief
rests in the failure to appreciate the fact that the instruments of the
state are merely the reflections of the political and economic ideology
of the dominant group, that the political arm of the state cannot be
divorced from its prevailing economic structure, whose servant it must
inevitably be.</p>
<p>Leaders of the American Negro like Dr. Du Bois, and organizations
such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
which he helped to found in 1909, have conducted a militant fight under
this illusory banner. They have demanded full equality for the Negro,
involving the eradication of all social, legal, and political
restrictions tending to draw a line of distinction between the black
citizen and the white. The Negro, like the white American, is to quaff
the full draught of eighteenth-century democratic liberalism. The Negro
individual citizen must have every right boasted by the individual white
citizen, including the franchise, freedom of economic opportunity
(consisting chiefly of the right to employment without discrimination),
the right to accommodations in public places and on common carriers, the
right to voluntary choice of his place of residence without involuntary
segregation, the right to jury service, and equal expenditures of public
funds for education and other public services. In pursuing this struggle
the Negro has been seriously handicapped, because he has never yet been
able to win any large measure of participation in the franchise. It is
estimated that today at least 90 per cent of the adult Negroes in the
Southern states are excluded from the suffrage, and it is here that the
great masses of the Negro population are concentrated. Consequently the
group leadership has had to lean heavily upon sympathetic white
supporters, lobbying, picketing, written and verbal protests, and
appeals, mass demonstrations, and the courts.</p>
<p>The confidence of the proponents of the political method of
alleviation is based on the protection which they feel is offered all
groups in the society by that sacred document the Constitution.
Particularly do they swear by the Bill of Rights and its three
supplements, the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments, as a
special charter of the black man’s liberties. The Constitution is thus
detached from the political and economic realities of American life and
becomes a sort of protective angel hovering above us and keeping a
constant vigil over the rights of all America’s children, black and
white, rich and poor, employer and employee and, like impartial justice,
blinded to their differences. This view ignores the quite significant
fact that the Constitution is a very flexible instrument and that, in
the nature of things, it cannot be anything more than the controlling
elements in the American society wish it to be. In other words, this
charter of the black man’s liberties can never be more than our
legislatures, and, in the final analysis, our courts, wish it to be.
And, what these worthy institutions wish it to be can never be more than
what American <span class="pagenum">316</span> public opinion wishes it
to be. Unfortunately, so much of American public opinion is seldom
enlightened, sympathetic, tolerant or humanitarian. Too often it
resembles mob violence.</p>
<p><em>Interracial Conciliation.</em>—It follows, therefore, that the
policy of civil libertarianism is circumscribed by the dominant mores of
the society. Its success, in the final analysis, must depend upon its
ability to create a sympathetic response to its appeals among
influential elements in the controlling population. In the long run its
militancy must be softened and the inevitable tendency is for it to
conform to the general pattern of the genteel programs of interracial
conciliation, which attempt to cultivate the good will of the white
upper classes. The churches, the young men’s and young women’s Christian
associations, the interracial commissions, and social welfare agencies
such as the Urban League, are the leading institutions among the Negro
engaged in the dubiously valuable work of developing interracial fellow
feeling.</p>
<p>It is not surprising, therefore, that assertedly militant
civil-libertarian organizations like the N.A.A.C.P. should employ
tactics which are progressively less militant. Such organizations, if
they remain constant in their faith, are forced into a policy of
conciliation with the enlightened, <em>i.e.</em>, the ruling interests,
in the dominant group. They must rely upon sympathetic understanding and
fair play in their campaigns for social justice, and they can scarcely
expect to find these noble traits in the victimized and unenlightened
masses. Consequently, the more “liberal” the better elements of the
white South become, the less militant these associations can afford to
be. They can be militant, but only politely so; they can attack, but not
too harshly; they must entreat, bargain, compromise and capitulate in
order to win even petty gains. They must politely play the game
according to the rules even though they have no stakes. In other words,
they play cricket.</p>
<p><em>The Courts.</em>—Such policies merely reflect the fact,
established by the legal and political history of the group, that the
Negro in the United States is a special ward of the Supreme Court. The
Negro has had countless experiences which sufficiently establish the
fact that he has rights only as this august tribunal allows them, and
even these are, more often than not, illusory. It is only inadvertently
that the courts, like the legislatures, fail to reflect the dominant
mass opinion. It must be futile, then, to expect these agencies of
government to afford the Negro protection for rights which are denied to
him by the popular will. Moreover, even could we optimistically hope
that the Supreme Court, in its theoretical legal detachment, would go
counter to the popular will and wipe out the proscriptions imposed on
the Negro, as it appeared to do in the Scottsboro cases, the condition
of the group could not be greatly changed. In the first place, American
experience affords too many proofs that laws and decisions contrary to
the will of the majority cannot be enforced. In the second place, the
Supreme Court can effect no revolutionary changes in the economic order,
and yet the status of the Negro, as that of other groups in the society,
is <span class="pagenum">317</span> fundamentally fixed by the
functioning and the demands of that order. The very attitudes of the
majority group which fix the Negro in his disadvantaged position are
part and parcel of the American economic and political order.</p>
<p>The peculiar position of the Negro as a ward of the judiciary is
readily explained by his political history. The Civil War amendments
were designed to give him a rather nebulous freedom and to protect him
in his fundamental rights. The Thirteenth amendment guaranteed his
physical freedom. The Fourteenth purported to protect his right of life,
liberty and property, i.e., to afford him the full privileges and
immunities of citizenship, due process and equal protection of the laws.
The Fifteenth amendment assured him that he would not be deprived of the
suffrage because of his race, color, or previous servitude. These
measures were realistic, they recognized that the newly-emancipated
Negro citizen would be crushed by the Southern states unless special
protection were afforded him. They were applied directly as limitations
upon the states. But the Negro has never been accepted as a
participating, legal member of his Southern state. There is perhaps a
measure of government for the Negro in the South, but never of or by
him. The Southern states recognize no duty to insure or extend his legal
rights, and the Constitution imposes no such positive responsibility
upon them. The state governments, being “democratic” governments, were
keenly responsive to the popular will, and seriously devoted themselves
to the task of preserving the inferior status of the Negro population.
The issue is thus clearly drawn for the Negro. Against the subversive
laws of the state legislatures and decisions of the state courts he
opposes his “Constitutional rights.” The burden of proof is always upon
him. For the interpretation and realization of these rights he is forced
to appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Thus the Negro has been compelled to substitute the complicated,
arduous and expensive processes of litigation for the ballot box. What
other groups are able to do for themselves, the Negro hopes the
judiciary to do for him. There is more than ample evidence in the
decisions of the supreme tribunal of the land on questions involving the
rights of the Negro to disprove the possibility of any general relief
from this quarter.</p>
<p>The fight for the rights of the group before the courts directs
itself to such impairments and deprivations of civil liberties as
segregation, together with inferior accommodations and instruction in
the public schools, unequal apportionment of school funds, segregation
and inferior accommodations on common carriers, residential segregation,
exclusion from jury service, disfranchisement, and peonage. These evils
have all been attacked through litigation but with only indifferent
success. In scores of decisions on these questions the highest courts of
the land have amply demonstrated their willingness to acquiesce in the
prevailing attitudes of the dominant population in respect to the
Negro.</p>
<p>The legal theory behind such decisions is that race discrimination is
contrary to the Constitution only when it involves inequality in rights
or the possession by one race of rights <span class="pagenum">318</span>
which are denied to another solely because of its race. Race
“distinctions,” on the other hand, if based on substantial differences,
do not constitute discrimination. Such permissible race distinctions in
law are usually ascribed to one or more of the following motives: (1)
the prevention of race conflicts; (2) the preservation of race purity by
the prevention of intermarriage or of illicit sex relations; (3) the
existence of race peculiarities which demand recognition in special
legislation. It is well settled that statutes may be framed to attain
any of these objectives which will not be objectionable to the
protective clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p>Thus, since the Fourteenth amendment is directed only against action
by the states, a common carrier may, in the absence of federal
legislation, provide for the separation of white and Negro passengers in
interstate commerce.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Similarly, a restrictive covenant in
a deed of conveyance of real estate, by which the grantee covenants that
the property described shall never be used or occupied by, or sold,
leased or given to, any Negro, has been held not to contravene the
Fourteenth amendment. <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Statutes requiring separate public
schools for white and Negro children have long been sustained by the
courts, as was a statute of the state prohibiting the teaching of the
two races in the same private school. <a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>
Likewise, a state is upheld in requiring Chinese pupils to attend the
schools provided for Negro pupils. <a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Pursuing its racial
theories to the extreme, the Court has admitted that fornication, when
committed by persons of different races, may be punished more severely
by the state than when committed by persons of the same race. <a
href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>The ability of the courts to hand down what appear to be legally
sound opinions and still permit popular abuses of the Negro’s rights to
persist is largely due to the adroitness of the white legislators in the
art of drawing up and administering their laws. These abuses generally
occur under the protection of laws which are “fair on their face,” and
unless the court is disposed to look behind the face of the law to its
administration the Negro can receive no relief. This is admirably
illustrated by a comparison of the court’s attitude in the case of
<em>Yick Wo v. Hopkins</em><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> and <em>Plessy v.
Ferguson</em>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> In the Yick Wo case, involving the
discriminatory administration of a law to the disadvantage of Chinese,
the court, in deciding the case in favor of the appellants, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though the law itself be fair on its face and impartial in
appearance, yet, if it is applied and administered by public authority
with an evil eye and an unequal hand, so as practically to make unjust
and illegal discriminations between persons in similar circumstances,
material to their rights, the denial of equal justice is still within
the prohibition of the Constitution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ten years later, however, in <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em>, involving
an attack by a Negro on a “separate-but-equal-accommodations” provision
for common carriers in the law of the State of Louisiana, the court
accepted the act at its face value and refused to admit the contention
of violation of consti<span class="pagenum">319</span>tutional rights
advanced by the plaintiff. The court, in fact, endorsed the provision,
saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>. . . the case reduces itself to the question whether the statute of
Louisiana is a reasonable regulation, and with respect to this there
must necessarily be a large discretion on the part of the legislature.
In determining the question of reasonableness it is at liberty to act
with reference to the established usages, customs and traditions of the
people, and with a view to the promotion of their comfort, and the
preservation of the public peace and good order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps no better example of the tendency of the Supreme Court to
detach itself from political reality when questions involving Negro
rights are concerned and to resort to legal fictions, can be afforded
than the opinion of Justice Roberts in the recent Texas Primary case. <a
href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> It is seemingly of no concern to
the court in this unanimous decision that a party performs a vital
political function, that the Democratic Primary in Texas is in fact the
only significant election, and that exclusion from the primary robs the
Negro of his franchise. The Court could only see that the prohibitions
of the Constitution are prohibitions against the actions of the state,
and that a political party is a private, voluntary association,
presumably something akin to the Elks. It is significant to note that
Chief Justice Hughes, in handing down an opinion in one of the
celebrated Gold Clause cases, <em>Perry v. U.S.</em>, <a href="#fn12"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>
while solemnly discussing the obligation of the government to keep faith
with its contracts, said: “… the contractual obligation still exists
and, despite infirmities of procedure, remains binding upon the
<em>conscience of the sovereign.</em>”<a href="#fn13"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>
But Justice Roberts, in meeting the argument that if Negroes are refused
admission to the Democratic Primary in Texas they are in fact altogether
deprived of the suffrage, this sacred right of democratic government,
failed to recognize that the sovereign had any conscience at all, and
sought refuge in the dialectical stratosphere by admonishing that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So to say is to confuse the privilege of membership in a party with
the right to vote for one who is to hold a public office. With the
former the state need have no concern, with the latter it is bound to
concern itself, for the general election is a function of the state
government and discrimination by the state as respects participation by
negroes on account of their race or color is prohibited by the federal
constitution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, although the Democratic Primary actually takes the place of the
general election in Texas (as in most other states below the Mason and
Dixon Line), Mr. Roberts assures us that justice is served, since the
Negro may still go through the useless exercise of casting a shadow vote
at the general election. The decision is especially ironical in view of
the fact that the court invoked the Fourteenth amendment—the most
important section of the Negro’s charter of liberty—as the sanction for
thus denying him the franchise.</p>
<p>The recent discouraging decision of the Supreme Court in the Herndon
case gives eloquent testimony to the ability of the Court to avoid
delicate issues by hiding behind legal technicalities.</p>
<p>Such economic political tactics, <span class="pagenum">320</span>
while winning a minor and too often illusory victory now and then, are
essentially inefficacious in the long run. They lead up blind alleys and
are chiefly programs of escape. No minority group should relent in the
most determined fight for its rights, but its leadership should
recognize the limitations of opportunistic and socially blind policies.
The only realistic program for any minority group in modern America is
one which is based upon an intelligent analysis of the problems of the
group in terms of the broad social forces which determine its condition.
Certainly no program of opportunism and no amount of idealism can
overcome or control these forces. The only hope for the improvement in
the condition of the masses of any American minority group is the hope
that can be held out for the betterment of the masses of the dominant
group. Their basic interests are identical and so must be their programs
and tactics.</p>
