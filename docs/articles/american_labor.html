<p><span class="pagenum">376</span> During the past presidential
campaign, leaders of the National Conference for Progressive Political
Action were uncertain of the attitude that the rank and file would take
toward Negro affiliation and consequently hesitated to include Negro
representation in the movement.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> But when certain Negroes
who, like the progressives, recognized the political and economic
ineptitude of the ascendant parties and therefore the necessity of
re-aligning political forces, without regard to the race problem,
insisted upon identification with the movement, the executive council of
the N.C.P.P.A. invited Negro liberals to the July convention. The speech
of a single unofficial Negro delegate stirred the convention and perhaps
lead to the creation of a Negro Division with headquarters at Chicago.
It would be very interesting to know just how successful the Negro
Division was in diverting Negro votes from the Republicans to the
Progressives. Of course an exact estimate is impossible. Negro
intellectuals, a mere handful when compared with the masses of Negro
voters, may have openly endorsed the La Follette-Wheeler combination,
but this is no reliable index to the distribution of the Negro vote. But
from the small amount of campaigning done it should follow that the
progressive vote among Negroes was almost nil. The election returns from
various sections of the country seemed to indicate that the Negro voted
almost solidly for Coolidge and Dawes and in the local elections voted
the Democratic ticket or assisted in electing independent candidates
possessing liberal views on the race question or in exceptional cases
elected Negro candidates.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The writer has observed a most intimate relationship with the Negro
bourgeoisie which comprises a large number of race-conscious business
folk, lawyers, doctors, etc.; the Negro of intellectual
aspirations—teachers, writers, preachers and social workers; and the
Negro workers whose racial attitudes are molded by the former classes.
The usual indictment made against the progressive movement by the Negro
worker was that the Conference for Progressive Political Action could
not be liberal to the Negro when the very unions which dominated it not
only discriminated against Negro membership in the union but denied
Negro workers the right to enter certain crafts.<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> The
other two classes of Negroes held that the progressives did not want the
Negro vote inasmuch as the La Follette-Wheeler platform made no special
appeal to Negroes by endorsing a federal anti-lynching bill, or the
elimination of segregation in government buildings and disfranchisement
in Southern states.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is regrettable that intelligent Negro groups display such
a lack of appreciation for the general politico-economic reforms at
which liberal statesmen aim. The consummation of these reforms may do
more toward liberating the Negro from <span class="pagenum">377</span>
privations which he suffers as a submerged group than all of the voluble
enunciations of an abstract doctrine of inalienable rights or
recommendations for federal anti-lynching bills. But the Negro’s apathy
toward economic reform and progressive political action must be
considered, first, in the light of the strained relationship which
exists between the races generally, and the white and black workers
specifically; secondly, the sentiments which his experience has
occasioned him to build about the Republican Party; and, thirdly, the
persistent exploitation of this historic sentimentalism by the
Republican Party with the aid of adroit and sometimes unscrupulous Negro
politicians.</p>
<p>The Negro’s demand for political remedies for his ills and his
disinterest in simon-pure political and economic reforms has been
mistakenly attributed to a rapidly increasing race consciousness. From
the preceding analysis this is hardly tenable. As far back as the late
sixties the Negro displayed a similar apathy to economic reform,
requesting that special legislative reforms be enacted to meet racial
proscriptions. When the National Labour Union was espousing
Greenback-ism as the means of raising the economic status of the
workers, Negroes under the leadership of John M. Langston, a Republic
politician, participated in the first two labor congresses held by the
organization. Langston precautioned his followers against the Democrats
in the conventions. An open rift soon occurred, and the Negroes
organized separately but sent delegates to the congresses of the white
National Labor Union. The platforms adopted at the colored conventions
differed very appreciably from those of the white workers. Greenbackism,
taxation of government bonds, taxation of rich for war purposes, and
independent political action by the workers were carefully avoided. Such
measures were possibly omitted for fear of offending the Republican
Party or because their full significance was not fully appreciated.<a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The Negro conventions were chiefly
concerned with education and the creation of special homestead acts for
Negroes in the South. When the National Labor Union became the National
Labor Party, the Negro delegates finally cut the bare thread which held
them to the union. One delegate, Isaac Myers, from the colored National
Labor Union stated that independent political action by labor was
unnecessary, since all reforms could be obtained through the Republican
Party.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The Republican Party is looked upon by white Northern workers as
representing the interests of the business and commercial class; and the
Democratic Party, until recently, as more nearly representative of
working class aspirations. The southern workers make no such
distinction. They are wedded to the Democratic Party not so much because
of a belief in its fidelity to their economic interest as because of the
historic significance the Republican Party bears to the Negro with whom
white workers are at cross purposes.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> So the Southern white
workers’ alignment with a progressive political movement will more than
likely depend upon its attitude toward the Negro <span
class="pagenum">378</span> workers. In short, conflicting race
psychologies vitiate any reapproachment between white and black workers
and thus render impossible the unanimity of feeling and purpose
necessary for independent working class action in politics. How may
these psychologies be accounted for? Will not the stimulation of
intellectual candor through education shatter race traditions and
mythically founded hates? Our attention will be devoted in the rest of
the essay to answering these questions.</p>
<h2 id="the-social-heritage-from-the-slave-regime">The Social Heritage
from the Slave Regime</h2>
<p>Slavery as an economic circumstance involving black slaves and white
freemen gave rise to certain psychologies which, as the status of
subject and dominant groups became fixed by law and custom, determined
the character of contact and the extent to which it should take place
between whites and blacks. Hence the inevitable separation of whites and
blacks into different spheres of thinking and acting. Each effort made
by the subject group to change the <em>status quo</em> has met the
stronger resistance power of the dominant. But in his dealings with the
most dominant members of the white race, the Negro, ofttimes, is highly
revered, providing he keeps “in his place” In the South, Negroes who are
in the capacity of servants sit in sections reserved on public
conveyances and in public places for white persons. A Negro woman may
suckle a white child, but marriage between that child and one of the
Negro woman’s offspring would not only be considered preposterous by the
white parents but in all likelihood contemned by the white child. Or, in
the North, where Negroes have fewer legal restrictions, the association
between white and black university students, for instance, is seldom
free and intimate, while other students possessed with decidedly negroid
physical traits are received as social equals—as long as such students
are foreigners, or mistaken for foreigners.</p>
<p>In any of these cases, or similar ones, the attitudes upon which
racial separation is built are not reflexes of pure race (color)
psychology. Were these feelings attributable to color revulsion white
infants would not be given to black women to suckle; whites would not
relish the food prepared by their black cooks; nor would they have
consorted with black women in supplying the country with a mulatto
population. The feeling is apparently that due to a difference in class
accentuated by dissimilar physical traits which distinguish the dominant
from the subject group. Yet the relationship between the Negro and the
upper-class whites is far more amicable, albeit paternalistic, than that
existing between the Negro and the economically disadvantaged whites.
Here, class antipathy is acute.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> To this class of whites
the Negro is not only a dangerous competitor for economic preferment in
the social order but a <em>nigger</em>—something far lower in the human
scale than anything white could ever descend. On the other hand, the
Negro, partly conscious of this intra-racial competition, perceives the
white workers as descendants of “poor whites” whom he learned to despise
under the slave regime.</p>
<p>The commonalty of economic interests between these classes of
wage-earners is the hackneyed dictum of the radical propagandist. But
appeals to these groups to unite for common action have been futile.
Instead of labor solidarity one finds a slowly abating competition <span
class="pagenum">379</span> between skilled and unskilled,<a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> and
a silent persisting clash between white and black workers.<a href="#fn9"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> In
many instances, the organization of the Negro workers is actually
prohibited by the union’s constitution—e.g., the International
Association of Machinists, organized at Atlanta Georgia in 1889. A Negro
social welfare organization has devoted much attention to discrimination
against Negro workers by organized labor.<a href="#fn10"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>
Through the efforts of one of its Board members who is also a member of
the American Federation of Labor, agitation was led against the
exclusion of Negro members by certain unions. At the Cincinnati
Convention (1912.) the Executive Council reported that it had brought as
much pressure as possible, but without success, to induce the<br />
Railway Carmen and the boiler-makers to change their constitutions so as
to admit Negroes. However, the Council reported that it had organized
six systems of adjustment boards to assist colored freight handlers, and
that colored men had been organized in separate locals directly attached
to the American Federation of Labor. Similarly in 1900 Samuel Gompers
came out unequivocally for the inclusion of Negro workers in the
American Federation of Labor. Despite these attempts to dissolve color
barriers in the labor movement the majority of the crafts affiliated
with the American Federation of Labor persists in legislating against
Negro membership or in contriving equally as effective covert methods of
exclusion.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Discrimination in the unions react
as deleteriously upon the labor movement from an economic point of view
as upon the Negro workers Where Negroes are denied membership but are
still able to ply their craft, the wage rate received by them is usually
lower than the union wage scale. This means that the Negro usually works
under open shop conditions and because of it threatens union standards
and stability. On the other hand these conditions force them to observe
a lower standard of living, the effects of which are registered in
community maladjustment. It is because of the race hostility and
economic disadvantage induced by union discrimination that the National
Urban League has created a Department of Industrial Relations which aims
to affect a reapproachment between the white and black workers under the
leadership of the American Federation of Labor.</p>
<p>If racial attitudes prevent white and <span
class="pagenum">380</span> black workers from associating in trade
unions, how great is the probability that they will unite in a political
party for economic reform? Or, that by uttering a few Marxian epigrams,
economic class consciousness will be awakened in white and black
workers? The Negro may be continually admonished of being exploited by
white capitalists, but experience and tradition, perhaps, lead him to
wonder if working for a white employer at a wage slightly below that
paid his white competitor is as great a handicap as ostracism or
double-dealing by the union. His calculations are usually in favor of
the employer.</p>
<p>The fortunate few among the Negro workers have escaped the wages
system into self-employment through the establishment of race
enterprises which oft-times have been successful. Others who have
remained wage-earners accept unionism, if at all, hesitatingly or
possibly with a crude pragmatism.</p>
<p>So insuperable has seemed the task of allaying the mutual suspicion
of white and black workers that even radicals have lost most of their
ardor for emancipating black “wage-slaves.” This, however, is not true
of the handful of Communists who constitute the Workers’ Party of
America and who believe that the Negro workers’ recent advent into
machine industry will inevitably mean his awakening to working-class
consciousness.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> An infinitesimal minority of black
communist apostles are relied upon to proselyte the Negro workers for
the class struggle.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> It is very likely that the present
attitude of white organized labor which, itself, is not class conscious,
and the Negro’s gradual emergence in the open shop from the ranks of
unskilled labor into that of the skilled, may accentuate his
individualism and thus shatter the communists* spectacular puerile
forecasts. Like the <em>Messenger Magazine</em>,<a href="#fn14"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>
the erstwhile mouthpiece of socialism among Negroes, the Communists too
will ultimately retire from the field of radical propaganda. Upon
gradually losing the support of white radicals, and realizing that as an
organ of socialistic propaganda, it could not safely rely upon the Negro
for constant support, the <em>Messenger</em> became a literary monthly.
Whatever the editor’s closet <em>welt-anschauung</em> may be, the
<em>Messenger</em> is no longer the mouthpiece of “scientific
radicalism.” Where the magazine once carried the socialist emblem,
“Workers of the World Unite,” it now places a tribute to Negro business
enterprise.</p>
<p>In spite of all that has been said, one should not be dogmatic about
the future significance of the Negro’s industrial advance to the
organized labor movement.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> As the migration of
the black <span class="pagenum">381</span> workers continues, bitter
experience may teach organized labor the necessity of lowering its
barriers so as to admit more of these workers. And as the Negro workers
become more acclimated to the ways of capitalism—its waves of
unemployment, the periodicity of industry, industrial hazards and the
individual worker’s insecurity—they may evince a keener desire to
control some of the disabilities they suffer under the wages system.
Collective bargaining and unionism may then be expected. But labor
solidarity and independent political action are contingent upon a change
in race attitudes and relationship. As reflected by the working masses
this transformation will only follow in consequence of a revolution of
opinion among enlightened black and white leaders.</p>
<h2 id="liberalism-and-the-negro">Liberalism and the Negro</h2>
<p>A growing race consciousness, both among the masses and the educated
Negroes, is the matrix from which issues a quick resentment to real and
imagined grievances. In extreme cases the proverbial “chip” is carried.
Evidences of this awakened consciousness are the demands for Negro
business enterprises, slogans of “patronize your own” and efforts to
create in the Negro a deeper appreciation for his cultural contributions
to Western civilization.</p>
<p>The Garvey movement, with its black Christs and Madonnas is symbolic
of a color psychosis which may easily develop from an extreme racial
positive-self-feeling. If the Negro’s ever-increasing self-assertion is
not guided by Negro intellectuals possessed of catholic vision, it will
build within the present order a self-illuminating black world oblivious
to things white. If guided by such leadership, his contributions to
music, art and literature may exceed present calculations, or his
alignment with some phases of liberal thought may definitely be
established. Such a task is more easily delegated to the Negro
intellectual than accomplished by him. His education and balked
ambitions render him more race conscious than the ignorant and
disadvantaged Negro. Secluded in his room, a Negro intellectual may try
to surpass Marx in determining how best to deliver the capitalist into
the hands of the proletariat. When this same Negro enters his real world
where he encounters the apathy of his own group and the hostility of the
white, very likely he ponders the feasibility of the converse
proposition. Without doubt many Negroes would be more inclined to an
acceptance of radical and liberal doctrines were it not for these
circumstances. Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois long ago recognized the quandary in
which the intellectual Negro is placed by the race problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They must perpetually discuss the Negro problem, must live, move and
have their being in it, and interpret all else in its light or darkness.
From the double life that every American Negro must live as a Negro and
as an American, as swept on by the current of the twentieth century
while struggling in the eddies of the fifteenth—from this must arise a
powerful self-consciousness and a moral hesitancy which is almost fatal
to self-conscousiness.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As shown in the first part of the essay, race psychology thwarts
comprehensive progressive political action and the growth of liberalism
in America. The same force is now seen as an obstruction to universality
of thought among Negroes. So absorbed is the Negro intellectual with the
race problem that problems of labor, housing, taxation, judicial reform
and war, all of which affect him, must needs be relegated to the limbo
of minor significance. And the Negro who aspires to intellectual
heights, but at the same time <span class="pagenum">382</span> gives
himself up to advocating remedial racial legislation, organizing equal
rights leagues or proving that his race is not mentally inferior to the
white—without becoming a propagandist or an inflated racialist—is put to
his wit’s end in an attempt to syncretize incongruous ideals.</p>
<p>Another deterrent to the advance of Negro liberalism is the race’s
religiosity. The harsh environment in which the Negro found himself as a
slave made a normal expression of his social impulses impossible—his
emotions were suppressed. Consequent upon his introduction to
Christianity these pent-up emotions found a channel of expression. They
were directed toward constructing sentiments around an otherwordly
symbolism; and thus his world of despair was robbed of reality. What is
often taken for an indigenous religious temperament on the Negro’s part
is in truth a mere compensatory or defense mechanism which persists
because the complexes which gave rise to it have only been superficially
disturbed. The success of religious leaders in holding the Negro
steadfastly orthodox may be largely attributable to the latter’s effort
to escape reality. Thus this leadership, in administering to the Negro’s
spiritual needs, augments the psychic compensation derived from
super-natural values. As such it is both cause and effect of orthodoxy.
Under these conditions, advanced thinking, whether it brings religious
skepticism, economic radicalism, social reform and re-adjustment, or the
repudiation of hoary political traditions, must futilely run the
gauntlet of religious orthodoxy, if it would gain audience. One would
logically assume, in light of the Negro’s years of persecution, that he
would possess a highly developed sense of sympathy for the strivings of
other submerged classes, and that his leaders would be more acutely
imbued with a sense of social justice. Sociologists are about agreed
that a religious faith requires an uncritical belief in its doctrines
and demands that these be placed above other truths as sacred eternal
verities. According to Maurice Parmelee, “the attitude encouraged by
science is such as to permit free intercourse without restriction
between all parts of mankind, while the mental attitude not only
encouraged but positively required by religion will always serve as a
barrier to the most highly developed and most extensive form of
humanitarianism.”<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> This is as much applicable to the
Negro as a social group as to any other. Therefore, the Negro who should
take his place in the vanguard of liberalism, feeling unable to secure
an audience or, what is worse, the assurance of income for maintenance,
closets from public inspection whatever advanced views he holds.</p>
<p>In assigning causes for the Negro’s social conservatism and lack of
intellectual daring, pseudo-anthropologists have revitalized Gobineau’s
racial determinism. These racialists support their acceptance of this
doctrine by creating categories of racial psychic endowment arising out
of a difference in germ plasm due to environmental selection. Thus white
man’s civilization is to be attributed to the Nordic’s restlessness and
to his spirit of conquest and mental indefatigability. Similarly,
docility, indifference to the future, non-purposiveness in thought,
imitativeness and minstrelsy are designated negroid characteristics.<a
href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Although the present essay is not
designed to refute the transmission of acquired traits or the notion
that characteristics which have been conveniently, albeit speciously,
labelled <span class="pagenum">383</span> racial, are due to inherent
biologic factors, it questions the logic of attributing either the
passive nature of the Negro’s cultural development or his apathy to
advanced thought to the determinism of biological traits selected under
African environment.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> This <em>á priori</em> argument,
purporting to show the hereditary potency of an African environment in
Negro life, is such worthless speculation as to be dismissed without
serious comment. One need not go to far-removed Africa for an
explanation of the aforementioned features of Negro intellectual growth.
A much less doubtful source of information is to be found about us in
the observable sociologic phenomena which we have attempted to analyze
in this paper. From this analysis it does not appear that the absence of
intellectual aggressiveness and universalism are the result of
non-purposiveness in thought stunned by gratuitous African life, but a
reflex of the social forces of the environment in which the Negro has
lived almost three centuries. It does not seem to be inferior mind stuff
which renders him apathetic to liberal social movements, but a
circumstance of race which demands him to think ‘black.’ Buttressing
these walls of race division are competition between white and black
workers; American individualism and the Negro’s belief in it; the
Negro’s religious orthodoxy and his quickened sense of injury and
resentment to it. Here then are social forces which create black and
white worlds in American society and which are more fatal to the growth
of working class consciousness and the Negro’s intellectual achievement
and emancipation than is all the alleged influence of the environment in
which his forbears lived prior to their enslavement by white
Americans.</p>
