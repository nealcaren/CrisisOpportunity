<p><span class="pagenum">204</span> This study was begun in the month of
November, 1897, and was carried on during the month of December, 1897,
and the months of January, February, and May, 1898. The writer has
endeavored to ascertain the facts, and to present those facts in such a
way that we may be able to see from them the trend of crime among the
negroes of Chicago, i.e. whether it is increasing or decreasing, and how
this crime compares with the crime among the other peoples of the city,
and of the country in general.</p>
<h2 id="the-negro-and-crime-in-the-united-states">The Negro and Crime in
the United States</h2>
<p>Before taking up the study of crime among the negroes of Chicago, it
is perhaps best to notice briefly their crime for the entire United
States. From the census reports we see that the total number of
prisoners in the United States in 1890 was 82,329; of these 24,277 were
negroes. The negro prisoners were 29.49 per cent, of the entire number.
When the different nationalities are considered, the negroes are found
to be the third highest.</p>
<p>A further fact that the Eleventh Census shows in respect to negro
crime is that there is a greater number of negro prisoners, in
proportion to the negro population, in the northern than in the southern
states. The Eleventh Census gives the ratio of prisoners in the United
States by division of states. From this we see that the ratio of negro
prisoners for the United States in 1890 was three times as great as that
of the whites; also that the highest ratio of the negro prisoners was in
the western division — 9,527 to the million of negro population. Further
we see that in the south central, north Atlantic, and western divisions
the ratio of negro prisoners is four times as great as that of the
white. In the south Atlantic the ratio is six times as great, and in the
north central the ratio of negro <span class="pagenum">205</span>
prisoners is eight times as great as that of the white. This would seem
to indicate that in the north central states there is a greater
difference in the proportion of crime among the whites and negroes than
in any other part of the United States.</p>
<p>A study of the Eleventh Census tables shows that the ratio of negro
prisoners to the negro population is greatest in the northern and
western states; also that the greatest difference in the proportion of
crime between the whites and negroes is in the northern and western
states; this seems to indicate that in these states the negro is more
given to crime than in the southern states. When we come to notice the
criminality of the negroes of Chicago, we shall see whether or not this
is true.</p>
<h3 id="increase-of-crime-from-south-toward-the-north">Increase of Crime
from South Toward the North</h3>
<p>Another fact that is shown by the Eleventh Census reports on crime is
that, taking the states from the south toward the north, there is a
gradual increase in the proportion of negro prisoners to the negro
population. It appears from this that from the south toward the north
there is a corresponding increase of crime among the negroes.</p>
<p>Taking Mississippi in the south central states for one
starting-point, and South Carolina in the south Atlantic states for
another, and going toward the north from these two points, we have in
each case a gradual increase in the ratio of negro prisoners to the
negro population as we go from state to state. It is further seen that
this gradual increase of crime has followed certain natural and
well-defined lines of travel. This increase is along the two natural
highways from the south toward the north, viz., the Mississippi valley
and the Atlantic seaboard.</p>
<h2 id="the-negro-population-of-chicago">The Negro Population of
Chicago</h2>
<p>Chicago, situated on Lake Michigan at the intersection of the great
inland arteries of trade and travel, is one of the foremost industrial
and commercial centers of the world. It is the second-largest city in
the United States, and had, according to the school census of 1896, a
population of 1,616,635. The negro population has during the last
thirty-six years increased in the city in about <span
class="pagenum">206</span> the same proportion as the total population.
The Chicago river and its north branch divide the city into three
sections or divisions, known as the north, west, and south divisions.
The negro population in 1896 was divided among these three sections as
follows: north division, 700; west division, 2,606; south division,
19,436.</p>
<h3 id="occupation">Occupation</h3>
<p>The majority of the men are employed as railroad porters, waiters,
janitors, elevator and bell boys, saloon porters, dock laborers,
foundrymen, house servants, and coachmen. There are a few in the trades
as carpenters, painters, etc., but these are decreasing. Several are in
the employ of the United States government as clerks and carriers in the
post-office. A few hold political appointments in the various
departments of the county and city government. In the professions are
found several doctors, dentists, lawyers, teachers, and clergymen. The
women are with few exceptions engaged in domestic service.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
There is a large class of unemployed negroes in the city, numbering
several hundreds. Could a careful census of this class be taken, it
would no doubt be found to reach into the thousands. From this class the
ranks of the criminals are recruited. Mention of this class will be made
later on in this study.</p>
<h3 id="nativity">Nativity</h3>
<p>The negroes of Chicago are from all parts of the United States; but
the majority are from the middle west and south central states,
Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri furnishing the largest number.</p>
<h3 id="church">Church</h3>
<p>There are in the city twenty-four negro church organizations,
scattered among the following denominations : Baptist, Catholic,
Episcopal, Methodist Episcopal, African Methodist Episcopal, African
Methodist Episcopal Zion, Free Methodist, and Presbyterian. Of these
different church organizations, ten own their <span
class="pagenum">207</span> property and worship in their own edifices.
The others are what are popularly known as mission churches. These
twenty-four places of worship have an approximate seating capacity of
10,000 persons. The membership is about 6,500 persons. The church
attendance, including all casual attendants at funerals and like
occasions, is about 12,000. This would leave some 10, 000
non-churchgoers among the negroes, out of a total population of 22,742,
or 44 per cent.</p>
<p>In all social studies of the negro the church must be considered, for
it is one of the greatest factors in his social life. It is not only the
religious, but also the moral, intellectual, and social center of his
community. When the church removes from a district inhabited by negroes,
nothing else comes in to take its place. Hence in this study we must
notice the relation of the negro churches to the negro slum
population.</p>
<p><em>The proximity of the negro churches to the negro slum
population.</em>—The negro slum population of Chicago may be said to be
comprised within two districts, viz., the levee district in the south
division, and the seventeenth and eighteenth wards in the west division,
or that part of them that is bounded on the east by Jefferson street, on
the north by Grand avenue, on the west by Ann street, and on the south
by Madison street. These two wards had in 1896 a negro population of
895. About 800 of these are found within the limits just defined.</p>
<p>The negro slum population of the levee district is comprised within
the following boundaries, viz.: Michigan avenue on the east, Van Buren
street on the north, the Chicago river on the west as far south as
Sixteenth street; from this point by Clark street to Twenty-second
street; on the south by Twenty-second street. This district had in 1896
a negro population of 4,900. Adding to this the 800 in the west
division, we have a total of about 5,700 negro persons living in the
slums of Chicago in 1896.</p>
<p>In the districts mentioned above there are no negro churches,
excepting one or two struggling missions. These 5,700 persons are
practically outside the influence of the church. Of the numerous social
settlements located in Chicago, none are in localities where the negroes
dwell in any large numbers; so that the <span class="pagenum">208</span>
negroes of the slum districts are practically untouched by the social
settlements. Of all the peoples dwelling in Chicago’s slums the negroes
are the most neglected. They are the ones that need the most done for
them; for it is among them, as we shall see, that the largest proportion
of crime is found.</p>
<h3 id="the-negro-slum-population-and-the-total-negro-population">The
Negro Slum Population and the Total Negro Population</h3>
<p>The negro slum population, as we have seen, is about 5,700. The total
negro population of the city is seen to be 22,742; 25 per cent., or
one-fourth of the entire number, live within the slum districts. It is
to be noticed, however, that there is a large migration of the negroes
from the slum districts toward the more respectable parts of the city;
<em>e.g.</em> the first ward of the city, which is comprised within the
district mentioned as the levee, had in 1890 a negro population of
3,381; in 1896 the negro population of this ward was 1,983, a decrease
of 1,398.</p>
<p>The total population of the first, second, seventeenth, and
eighteenth wards of the city, which comprise within their boundaries the
districts mentioned as slums, was 106,527. The negro population of these
wards was 7,052. Of the entire population of these wards the percentage
of negroes was 6.62. Of the city at large we have seen that in 1896 it
was 1.40. From this it appears that Chicago has a very large negro slum
population when compared with the total number of negroes living in the
city. The Seventh Special Report of the Commissioner of Labor, 1894,
<em>Slums of Great Cities</em>, p. 27, shows that Chicago has a larger
negro slum population than either Baltimore, New York, or
Philadelphia.</p>
<p>It is to be remembered that not all the negroes living in the
districts which have been designated as slums in this work are
disreputable or criminal. Many of the best negro families of the city
live within these districts. But in speaking of the population of the
slums, all persons living therein must be included.</p>
<h2 id="crime-of-negroes-in-chicago">Crime of Negroes in Chicago</h2>
<p><em>Police arrests</em>.—The arrests made from year to year in the
police departments of great cities may be regarded as an <span
class="pagenum">209</span> approximately true indicator of the criminal
tendencies of the times; for almost all the inmates of prisons have
passed through the hands of the police. On the records of the police
department are placed data relating to the individual arrested and the
nature of his crime. Because of the data thus obtainable the writer has
made a special study of the police records of the city. The period
covered by this study is the past twenty-six years, <em>i.e.</em>, from
1872 to 1898. The police records of arrests in the city were not
obtainable for an earlier period than 1872. The yearly reports back to
this time were obtainable with the exception of the year 1873 and a part
of the report for 1874.</p>

<p>By this comparison we see that in 1872 the ratio of negro arrests to

<p>From this table we see that the ratio of negro arrests to the negro
population is from three to nine times as great as the ratio of total
arrests to the total population.</p>
<p>The ratio of negro arrests to the negro population, compared with the
ratio of foreign arrests to the foreign population, shows that the ratio
of arrests for the foreign population and the ratio of arrests for the
total white population is about the same. The proportion of arrests
among the negroes is about six times as great as the proportion of
arrests among the total foreign population.</p>
<p>With the exception of the Chinese, Greeks, and Mexicans, the
proportion of arrests among the negroes to the negro population is from
two to eighteen times as great as the proportion of arrests among the
different foreign peoples of the city.</p>
<p>A comparison of the negro arrests, 1890-97, in Chicago with the negro
arrests in New York city, Washington, D. C., Richmond, Va., and
Charleston, S. C., shows that the ratio of negro arrests in Charleston
is but slightly greater than the ratio of negroes in the total city
population; in Richmond the ratio of negro arrests to the total arrests
is one and one-fourth times greater than the ratio of the negro
population to the total population; in Washington and New York the ratio
is one and a half times as great; while in Chicago the ratio of negro
arrests to the total arrests is seven times as great as the ratio of the
negro population to the total population.</p>
<p>The negro arrests in these cities compared with the negro population
show that the proportion of negro arrests in Chicago is from two to five
times as great as the proportion of negro arrests to negro population in
these cities; e. g., in 1890 the <span class="pagenum">211</span> ratio
of negro arrests to negro population was: in New York, 1 to 12;
Washington, 1 to 6; Richmond, 1 to 8; Charleston, 1 to 13.5; Chicago, 1
to 2.6. In 1897 the ratio of negro arrests to negro population was: in
New York (1896), 1 to 7; Washington, 1 to 6.3; Richmond, 1 to 9.7;
Chicago, 1 to 3. In New York, during 1890, the ratio of negro arrests to
the negro population was one and a half times as great as the ratio of
white arrests to the white population; in Washington, Richmond, and
Charleston the ratio of negro arrests was twice as great as the ratio of
white arrests; in Chicago the ratio of negro arrests to the negro
population was six times as great as the ratio of white arrests to the
white population.</p>
<p><em>Chicago house of correction</em>.—The proportion of negro
prisoners sent each year to the Chicago house of correction has
increased during the past twenty-five years; the proportion sent from
1890 to 1898 is from two to three times as great as the proportion sent
each year from 1873 to 1890.</p>
<p>From a comparison of the proportion of negroes in the city’s
population with the proportion of negroes confined in the house of
correction we see that in 1873 the proportion of negro prisoners
confined in the Chicago house of correction was 2.7 as great as the
proportion of the negro population to the total population of the city;
in 1880 the proportion of negro prisoners was 2.5 times as great; in
1890 it was 6 times as great; in 1892 it was 8 times as great; in 1894
it was 9 times as great; and in 1896 the proportion of negro prisoners
confined in the Chicago house of correction to the total number of
prisoners confined therein was 8 times as great as the proportion of
negroes in the total population of the city.</p>
<p><em>Cook county jail</em>.—The city of Chicago is in Cook county,
111. The jail for the county is located in this city. The United States
census for 1890 showed that there were at that time 279 prisoners in the
Cook county jail, of whom 31 were negroes. The writer visited the jail
February 3, 1898. On that day there were 400 prisoners, of whom 45 were
negroes. The writer also visited the same institution May 23, 1898. At
this time there were 431 prisoners, of whom 50 were negroes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">212</span> From these figures we see that on
the day the census for the Cook county jail was taken in 1890 one-ninth
of the prisoners were negroes. On the days that the writer visited the
jail in February and May of this year about one-ninth of the prisoners
were negroes. These facts would seem to indicate that about one-ninth of
the prisoners confined in the Cook county jail during the past eight
years have been negroes.</p>
<p>The population of Cook county in 1890 was 1,191,222. The negro
population of the county was 14,910. The ratio of negro population in
the county to total population was 1 to 79. The ratio of negro prisoners
in the jail to total prisoners was 1 to 9 in 1890 and 1898. Therefore we
can conclude that the proportion of prisoners furnished to the county
jail by the negro population of Cook county during the past eight years
was from eight to nine times as great as it should have been according
to the number of the negroes in the county.</p>
<p><em>Social relations</em>.—The writer was permitted to have access to
the records of the police arrests of the city. From them he selected the
records for the months of January and May, 1897. The reports of the
second, third, and fourth police precincts were examined. These
precincts are in the slum districts of the city, and within their
boundaries the majority of negro arrests are made. The records for
sixteen days in May and ten days in January were gone over,
<em>.i.e.</em>y from May 15-30 and January 1-10. The negro arrests for
these periods were picked out and classified according to sex, age,
occupation, conjugal relation, and the nature of the complaints lodged
against them. Four hundred and twenty-seven negro arrests were thus
examined; 272 from May 15-30, and 155 from January 1-10.</p>
<p>The writer was also allowed to have access to the records of
criminals as kept in the Bureau of Identification of Criminals. Here he
was enabled to examine the records of negro persons who had been classed
as criminals. The writer examined 217 identifications of negroes, and
noted the age, sex, occupation, nativity, complexion, and crime of the
persons thus recorded.</p>
<p>At the county jail he was unable to obtain anything except the number
and sex of negro prisoners and the charges for <span
class="pagenum">213</span> which they were held. At the house of
correction he was also unable to secure any data relative to the social
relations of the negro prisoners.</p>
<p><em>Sex</em>.—Of the 427 negro arrests examined for the months of
May, and January, 1897, 242 were males and 185 were females. Of the
arrests made during the sixteen days of May, 128 were of males and 144
of females. Of the arrests made during the ten days of January, 114 were
of males and 41 of females. From this we see that in May the arrests
among the females exceeded those among the males, while in January the
arrests among the males were almost three times as many as those among
the females. This would seem to indicate that the proportion of female
arrests to the male arrests is greatest in the warmer months. The
largest number of all arrests is made in the warm months of spring and
summer, <em>e.g.</em>, the greatest number of arrests made during 1897
was in the month of May—9,620; the smallest number made during any one
month was in February—4,000. This is true of all years.</p>
<p>The ratio of negro female arrests to the total negro arrests is 1 to
2.3. The total arrests for the city for 1897 were 83,680; female
arrests, 17,624, or 1 to 4. From this we may infer that the proportion
of female arrests among the negro population is about twice as great as
the proportion of female arrests among the total population of the
city.</p>
<p>An examination of the police reports of the city of New York from
1889 to 1896 shows that the average ratio of yearly negro female arrests
to total yearly negro arrests is 1 to 2. Therefore we may conclude that
the proportion of negro female arrests is about the same in the two
cities. In Charleston, S. C., the ratio of negro female arrests to the
total yearly negro arrests is as follows: 1890, 1891, 1896, and 1897, 1
to 5; during 1892, 1893, 1894, and 1895, 1 to 6. From this we see that
the proportion of negro female arrests to the total negro arrests is
from two to three times as great in Chicago as in Charleston.</p>
<p>Of the total number of prisoners in the county jail at the time of
the taking of the United States census in 1890, 1 in every 10 was a
female. Of the negro prisoners at this time 1 in <span
class="pagenum">214</span> every 3 was a female. On May 23, 1898, 1 in
every 16 of the total number of prisoners was a female, and 1 in every
4.5 of the negro prisoners was a female. From this we may conclude that
the proportion of female negro prisoners is greatly in excess of the
proportion of total female prisoners confined in the county jail.</p>
<h3 id="age">Age</h3>
<p><em>Ages of negroes under general police arrests.</em>—The average
age of the 427 negro persons arrested by the police in May, and January,
1897, was twenty-six years. The average age of the males was 25.29;
females, 26.70. The largest number of arrests is of persons from twenty
to twenty-five years of age. From a comparison of the total arrests for
1897 with the negro arrests for January and May it would appear that the
proportion of arrests for the total population and the negro population
is about the same for persons between the ages of ten and twenty; that
the proportion of negro arrests is greater for persons between the ages
of twenty and thirty than the proportion of total arrests for persons of
that age; and that the proportion of total arrests is greater for all
persons over thirty years of age than the proportion of negro arrests
for negro persons over that age.</p>
<p><em>Classification of ages by sex.</em>— Classified by sex it is seen
that the largest number of male arrests among the negroes was of persons
from twenty to twenty-five years of age, and that the majority of male
arrests were of persons less than twenty-five years of age. Also that
there was a larger percentage of negro male arrests between the ages of
ten and twenty than the percentage of total arrests between those
ages.</p>
<p>Comparing the male and female arrests of negroes, we see that there
is a less proportion of female arrests under the age of twenty years
than of males, the percentage of female arrests under twenty years of
age being 10, male 22; also that there is a greater proportion of
arrests among the females from twenty to twenty-five years of age than
among the males for that period, the percentage of female arrests for
that period being 41 per cent., male 30 per cent.; from twenty-five to
thirty years of age the proportion of female arrests is also greater
than the males, the <span class="pagenum">215</span> percentage of
arrests of females from twenty-five to thirty being 29 per cent., males
22 per cent.; after thirty years of age the proportion of arrests is
greater among the males than among the females. Twenty-four per cent, of
the male arrests were of persons over thirty years of age, 19 per cent,
of the female arrests were of persons above that age.</p>
<p><em>Ages of negro criminals</em>.—The persons whose ages we have been
considering come under the head of general police arrests,
<em>.i.e.</em> those arrested for all causes. We will now notice those
classed as criminals.</p>
<p>The ages here given are of persons who have been recorded in the
Bureau of Identification of Criminals, and are therefore said to belong
to the criminal class. The records of 217 negro persons were examined;
120 were males and 97 were females. The average age of these 217 negro
persons was twenty-four years; average age of males was 25.74; females,
22.63. From a classification of ages it appears that the majority of
negro persons classed as criminals are between the ages of fifteen and
twenty-five years; that the largest proportion of persons is between the
ages of twenty and twenty-five. Taking the percentages, we see that 64
per cent, are between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five years, and
that 43 per cent, are between the ages of twenty and twenty-five years,
and that only 36 per cent, are above twenty-five years of age.</p>
<p>From the classification of ages under general negro arrests we see
that 52 per cent, of the negro arrests were of persons between the ages
of fifteen and twenty-five years, 35 per cent, between the ages of
twenty and twenty-five years, and 48 per cent, beyond the age of
twenty-five years. From the ages under general arrests we have seen that
the average age of negro persons thus arrested was twenty-six years; the
average age of males was 25.29 years, females 26.70 years. From the
classification just considered we see that the average age of negro
persons classed as criminals was twenty-four, males 25.74, females 22.63
years. This would seem to indicate that the proportion of negro persons,
between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five years, classed as criminals,
to the total number so classed, is greater than the <span
class="pagenum">216</span> proportion of negroes of this same age in the
general negro arrests to the total general negro arrests of the
city.</p>
<p><em>Classification of ages by sex.</em>—Classified by sex it appears
that the majority of negro criminals are between the ages of fifteen and
twenty-five years, and that the largest number of these are between the
ages of twenty and twenty-five; also that there is a larger percentage
of negro females between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five classed as
criminals, to the total number of negro females so classed, than of
negro males between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five, classed as
criminals, to the total number of negro males so classed. We see further
that 90 per cent, of the negro females classed as criminals, and 71 per
cent, of the males so classed, are between the ages of fifteen and
thirty.</p>
<p>This would seem to indicate that negro female criminals become so at
an earlier age than negro male criminals, and that criminality among the
negro females decreases after the age of twenty-five years. Criminality
among the negro males decreases after the age of thirty years. From this
we may conclude that the tendency to crime among the negroes decreases
with advancing age. This same fact is noted in the United States census
reports on <em>Crime, Pauperism, and Benevolence</em>, Part I, “Analysis
of Statistics,” p. 167.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Marital relations</em>.—The writer was unable to ascertain the
marital relations of any class of negroes connected with crime, except
those coming under the head of general police arrests.</p>
<p>Of the 427 general negro arrests made by the police of the city in
January and May of 1897, 60 were of married persons and 367 were of
single. The percentage of married persons was 14. Of the total arrests
of the city for 1897, 24,608 were of married and 59,072 were of single;
29 per cent, of the total arrests of the city were of married persons.
This would seem to indicate that the proportion of single negro persons
arrested to the total <span class="pagenum">217</span> negro arrests is
much greater than the proportion of single persons arrested for the
total arrests of the city.</p>
<p>The United States Census Reports on Crime for 1890 give the following
percentages for the marital relations of negro prisoners: single, 62.43;
married, 33.51. The percentage for the marital relation for the total
prisoners of all nationalities was: single, 63.68; married, 30.04. The
percentage for the whites was: single, 64.25; married, 28.54. From these
percentages it is seen that the negroes had the largest percentage of
married persons. The small percentage of married persons among the
arrests of negroes in Chicago is probably accounted for by the fact that
there is an ever-increasing number of young and unmarried negro persons
coming into the large cities from the country and small towns.</p>
<p><em>Occupations</em>.— Of the 427 negro persons under general
arrests, 329, or 75 per cent., had, or gave, no occupation. Of the total
arrests of the city, 83,680, for the year 1897, 32,158, or 38 per cent.,
were arrests of persons without occupations. This great difference in
the percentage of persons arrested without occupations would seem to
indicate that the proportion of negroes in Chicago without occupation or
unemployed is greater than the proportion of unemployed in the total
population of the city.</p>
<p>From the list of occupations given by those classed as criminals it
is seen that a greater number had an occupation of some sort than those
under the head of general police arrests. Also that there is a more
varied list of occupations. Comparing those without occupations, classed
as criminals, with those without occupations in the total general
arrests in the city, we see that the negroes still have a larger number
without occupations. Thirty-eight per cent, of the total arrests were of
persons without occupations; 42 per cent, of negro criminal arrests were
of persons without occupations. Previous mention has been made of the
large number of unemployed negroes in the city, and it is now seen that
from this class comes a large part of the negro arrests and crimes.</p>
<p><em>Nativity</em>.—The 217 persons classed as criminals were from
twenty-seven different states of the United States, and two foreign
countries. This is due to the fact, which has already <span
class="pagenum">218</span> been noted, that the negro population of
Chicago is made up of negroes from all parts of the United States. The
largest number of criminals are from Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri.
It is from these states, as has already been stated, that the largest
number of negroes in Chicago has come.</p>
<h3 id="offenses">Offenses</h3>
<p><em>Offenses of negro persons under the head of general
arrests.</em>— Comparing offenses for May and January with offenses of
total arrests, we see that the proportionate number of negroes arrested
for assault and burglary is less than the proportionate number of total
arrests for these offenses; that for larceny and vagrancy the
proportionate number of negroes arrested is about the same as the
proportionate number of total arrests for these offenses; and that the
proportionate number of negroes arrested for disorderly conduct and
robbery is greater than the proportionate total arrests for these
offenses.</p>
<p>Classification of offenses.— Eighty per cent, of offenses were
against society; 74 per cent, of the offenses against society were
offenses against public peace; 11 per cent, of the offenses were against
property, and 7 per cent, against the person.</p>
<p><em>Offenses of negro persons classed as criminals</em>.—The three
offenses of larceny, burglary, and robbery predominate; the largest
number of persons, as would be expected, committed larceny; 42 per cent,
of all offenses were larceny; 16 per cent, of all persons committed or
attempted burglary, and 18 per cent, committed or attempted robbery.
From the Census Reports on Crime for 1890 it is seen that 28 per cent,
of all negro persons then confined in prison had been committed for
larceny, 11 per cent, for burglary, and 2.38 per cent, for robbery.</p>
<p>Offenses by sex.— Burglary, it appears, is an offense committed
almost entirely by the males; also that the tendency to commit larceny
and robbery is greater among the females than among the males.
Fifty-eight per cent, of the total offenses committed by the females
were of larceny, against 26 per cent, of the males for this same
offense; 24 per cent, of the females committed robbery, against 12 per
cent, of the males for this <span class="pagenum">219</span> offense. It
is further seen that 5.15 per cent, of the females committed murder,
against 1.66 per cent, of the males.</p>
<p>Classification of offenses.—All the offenses come under the two
groups of offenses against the person and against property; 84 per cent,
of the offenses are against property.</p>
<p>Classification by sex.—The majority of both male and female offenses
are against property. But there is a larger percentage of female
offenses against property than of male offenses against property.
Eighty-seven per cent, of the total female offenses are against
property, and 81 per cent, of the male offenses.</p>
<p><em>Jail offenses.</em>— Negroes confined in jail May 23,1898.
Thirty-six per cent, of the offenses were larceny, 24 per cent, were for
murder or attempted murder, 16 per cent, were for robbery. This high
percentage of homicides or attempted homicide is to be noticed.</p>
<p>Offenses by sex.— The largest number of males committed larceny—38
per cent.; 27 per cent, of the females committed larceny. The largest
number of the females committed robbery— 36 per cent.; 10 per cent, of
the male offenses were of robbery. Eighteen per cent, of the females
were held for murder, and 5 per cent, of the males. We have already seen
under the head of negroes classed as criminals that there was a larger
percentage of females charged with robbery and murder than of males;
therefore we may conclude that the negro females of Chicago have more of
a tendency for robbery and homicide than the males.</p>
<p>Classification of offenses.—The largest percentage of offenses is
against property — 68 per cent.; 28 per cent, of the offenses are
against the person, and 4 per cent, against society.</p>
<p>Comparing this classification with the classification of offenses
under negroes classed as criminals, and with the census report on crime
(1890), it is seen that there is a larger percentage of offenses against
property than of any other offenses among the negroes of the United
States. It is also seen that this tendency is more manifested among the
negroes of Chicago than of the country at large.</p>
<p>Classification by sex.— Classified by sex, all the offenses of negro
females examined under jail arrests fall under the head of <span
class="pagenum">220</span> person and property; the offenses against the
person, 36 per cent., is greater than the per cent, of male offenses
against the person, 25 per cent. An examination of negro female offenses
under general arrests and of those classed as criminals shows that all
the female offenses considered come under the head of person and
property. For the country at large one-third of all offenses of negro
females are against society. It is also seen that there is a larger per
cent, of male offenses against society in the country at large than in
Chicago; that there is a larger percentage of offenses against the
person among the negroes of the country at large than of Chicago, and
that offenses against property predominate among both male and female
negroes in Chicago.</p>
<p><em>Complexion and offenses</em>.— Of the 217 records examined it was
found that 72 were of persons of black complexion, <em>.i.e.</em> the
negro blood predominated; 145 were of light complexion or of mixed
blood, <em>.i.e.</em>, Caucasian blood predominated. As to the crimes
committed by these different-complexioned criminals, the blacks
committed more of the offenses against the person and the mulattoes
against property. Of the four cases of rape that have been noted two
were by blacks and two were by mulattoes; of the seven murder cases
noted six were by black persons, five females and one male.</p>
<p><em>Age and offenses.</em>— Under the head of negroes classed as
criminals there were thirty-seven persons between the ages of fifteen
and twenty years. Considering the offenses of these persons, it is seen
that larceny offenses have the largest percentage— 43 per cent.; robbery
comes next, 30 per cent.; then burglary, 21 per cent.; and assaults, 6
per cent. We may then conclude that with negro criminals under twenty
years of age the tendency to commit offenses is in the following order:
the greatest tendency is to commit larceny, then robbery, burglary, and
assaults.</p>
<p>By sex it is seen that the tendency to larceny and assault is
greatest among the females under twenty years of age; that the tendency
to robbery is about the same in each sex; and that burglary is
exclusively confined to the males.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">221</span> Classifying the offenses, it is seen
that 94.59 per cent, of the offenses are against property and 5.41 per
cent, against the person; therefore we may say that the offenses of
negro criminals under twenty years of age are very largely against
property. By sexes it is seen that 100 per cent, of the male offenses
were against property and 89 per cent, of the female are against
property. We see that 11 per cent, of the female offenses are against
the person; therefore we may conclude that the tendency to crime against
the person is much stronger in negro females under twenty years of age
than in negro males under that age.</p>
<p>Of the seven murder cases noted under the head of negroes classed as
criminals it was seen that five were by females and two by males. The
ages of the females were respectively 22, 26, 27, 30, and 34 years. The
ages of the males were 29 and 31 years. The average age of females is
seen to be 27.80 years. The average age of the males is 30 years. This,
with what we have already seen in connection with offenses committed by
persons under twenty years of age, would seem to indicate that murder is
not committed at as early an age as larceny, burglary, and robbery; it
also appears that the females committed murder at an earlier age than
the males.</p>
<p><em>Habits</em>.—The writer was unable to collect any data relative
to the habits of negro criminals, beyond the fact that the opium habit
is quite prevalent among them and is increasing.</p>
<p><em>Literacy and illiteracy</em>.— Of the literacy and illiteracy of
the negro criminals of Chicago no data were collected. It is to be
presumed, however, because of the general educational advancement of the
negro, and the fact that the majority of them are less than twenty-five
years of age, that the greater number of the negro criminals of Chicago
are literate.</p>
<h3 id="is-crime-increasing">Is Crime Increasing?</h3>
<p>During the past twenty-five years there has been a very great
increase in the proportion of negroes arrested in the city, and the
numbers confined in the jail and house of correction, to the proportion
of negroes in the city’s population. The per cent, of negro arrests in
the total arrests has increased slightly in the <span
class="pagenum">222</span> past five years, from 1893-7, over the
previous five years, from 1888-92. The average per cent, of negro
arrests in the total arrests of the city 1888-92 was 9.41; 1893-7 the
average percentage was 9.50. The average percentage 1893-7 was 6.42.
Judging from this, crime among the negroes of Chicago appears to be on
the increase at the present time.</p>
<h2 id="the-cause-of-this-excess-of-crime">The Cause of this Excess of
Crime</h2>
<p>The question now arises: Why this excess of crime among the negroes
of Chicago and of the United States in general? Are they advancing or
retrograding? F. L. Hoffman, in <em>Race Traits and Tendencies of the
American Negro</em>, “Publication of American Economic Association,”
Vol. XI, 1896, takes the position that the negro is retrograding. Since
his emancipation he has made no real advancement in a moral or social
way. The fact that his tendency is downward accounts for a large part of
his excess of crime.</p>
<p>If the American negro is degenerating, then his degeneracy does, in a
large measure, account for his excess of crime. On the other hand, if he
is not degenerating, but making progress in civilization, then his
excess of crime must be accounted for on other grounds. Going on the
hypothesis of his social advancement, may we not say that, since his
emancipation, he has been in a transitional state—a transition from a
state of slavery to one of freedom? During all these years he has been
endeavoring to adjust himself to his new environment. He has had to
endure the economic stress and strain attendant upon this transition.
The fact that he is in this transitional state from a lower to a higher
plane of development accounts for a part, at least, of his excess of
crime. Within this transition the economic stress under which he has
labored appears to be the main factor. In the South his economic
condition is better in many ways than in the North. In those places
where his economic condition is the best his rate of crime is the
lowest. The reverse is also true: where his economic condition is
poorest his rate of crime is the highest. His economic condition is
poorer in Chicago than in the southern cities noted.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">223</span> There are other causes common to all
races that enter into the life of the negro and tend to increase his
criminality. These should not be overlooked. There are race
characteristics peculiar to him that also help. But it appears to the
writer that the fact of the negro being in a transitional state, and the
economic phase of this transition, accounts for a large part of the
excess of negro crime in the United States.</p>
