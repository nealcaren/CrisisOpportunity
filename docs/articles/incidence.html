<p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract: </strong>As a result of the
marginal status of Negro workers both in industry and agriculture the
depression began for them ahead of American workers generally. In
industrial centers their unemployment rates have consistently exceeded
the rate for white workers, due both to mass employment on the common
labor level of those industries most seriously curtailed and to
increased racial competition. Recovery programs have tended on the whole
to follow regional practices with respect to types of work and relief.
In many urban centers larger proportions of Negroes are permitted in the
relief rolls in consideration of higher unemployment rates. In rural
areas the proportions on relief and amounts spent per person have been
less than the white, despite greater need.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum">737</span>The year 1929 did not mark the
beginning of the acute unemployment situation for the Negroes. In
industry it could be observed as early as 1927 that their temporary
importance was waning. There were attempts to induce and even compel,
where possible, the return of surplus Negro labor to the South. In
numbers of southern cities, not yet aware that nation-wide unemployment
was impending, direct replacement of Negro by white labor was
encouraged. By 1929 it was conservatively estimated that there were no
less than 300,000 Negro industrial workers unemployed, and employment
offices were able to place less than a third of the applicants.</p>
<p>There is a striking consistency, throughout the industrial centers,
in the unemployment ratios for Negro workers. With a few notable
exceptions, the proportions of Negroes unemployed are from 30 to 60 per
cent greater than for white workers. Factors not directly related to
race have been responsible for a part of the great losses. The Negro
workers in the cities have been concentrated in the heavy industries.
Practically all of these have been forced to reduce output, resulting in
large lay-offs. Moreover, the largest single concentration of Negro
workers in industry has been in building construction, and this field
has been notoriously quiescent since the beginning of the depression. As
early as 1930 the highest recorded unemployed group of American workers
was that of building laborers. The vertical displacement downward of
unskilled workers has operated without special design to increase the
number of Negroes un<span class="pagenum">738</span>employed. Similarly,
the curtailed incomes of persons of moderate salaries have forced
discontinuance of the luxury of domestic servants, thus reducing Negro
employment in another important field.</p>
<p>It was inevitable that in the administration of the National Recovery
Act there should be encountered a conflict between the theory of the Act
and customary practices with respect to Negro workers. In northern
cities, where the question of wage differentials for the same grade of
work, chiefly unskilled and semi-skilled, has not been important, there
has been little effect of the codes. In such centers as Pittsburgh,
where Negroes have been employed in important numbers in the steel
industry, no significant loss of employment through displacement by
white workers has been felt. In smaller establishments in the North,
such as hotels and light manufacturing plants and laundries, entire
Negro crews have been released and all whites employed. Occasionally
such action has been modified by a shift back to Negro workers when the
new arrangement proved less satisfactory.</p>
<p>More serious difficulties have developed around the codes for
industries in the South, where the customary level of wages generally is
lower than in the North, and the wages of Negroes lower than the wages
of white workers. The necessity, under the code, for raising wages for
jobs held by Negroes had the effect of lending added attractiveness to
Negro jobs for a large body of unemployed white workers. As a measure of
economy, many jobs were combined by small employers and given added
responsibility, thus automatically eliminating other Negro workers. By
far the most widespread effect has been a result of the forcing to the
wall of numerous small substandard businesses which had been able to
operate only by paying extremely small wages. In these the jobs have
been held largely by Negroes.</p>
<p>Over a third of all Negro workers are in agriculture. Urbanization
has been forced by a long period of decline in agriculture. Tenancy for
both races has grown, and the decline in Negro ownership has been
persistent. The general depression reached the South when it was already
prostrate and sadly crippled by an outworn tenant system. With the
increase in cotton-growing countries throughout the world and the loss
of cotton export markets, it has now become evi<span
class="pagenum">739</span>dent that the old cotton area of the
Southeast, where the bulk of the Negroes live, will perhaps never regain
its old position.</p>
<p>The recovery measures aimed at stabilizing the price of cotton
suspended the collapse of the system, and assumed certain of the risks
of the owners, but left virtually untouched the large tenant population,
of which the Negroes constituted 55 per cent. The Agricultural
Adjustment Act aided the large owner by pegging cotton prices and by
providing essential credit and government subsidy for non-productive
activity. For the most part, however, the old methods of handling the
tenant have persisted under federal subsidy. The reduction program of
1933 and 1934 made possible a withdrawal of land from cultivation and,
despite the mild and ineffectual caution expressed in the act, resulted
in a corresponding reduction in the number of tenant contracts. Even for
those who remained there was striking and often indefensible inequality
in the distribution of the benefits of the subsidy. The cotton-reduction
program, accelerating current trends, has thus succeeded in eliminating
approximately 30 per cent of the Negro tenants from agriculture. The
“furnishing” system, by which a bare subsistence was possible over the
crop season, is in rapid collapse, and these tenants, without other
recourse, drift about aimlessly until they can establish themselves on
relief. Gordon W. Blackwell’s study of tenant displacement in North
Carolina,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> where cotton and tobacco have been
the important crops, provides another index to the general trends. In
this state alone there were between 8,000 and 11,000 tenant farm
families without a crop for 1934, and about 75 per cent of these
families were on relief.</p>
<p>Generally considered, the 1934 agricultural program and the Bankhead
Act have been almost exclusively the instruments of the landlord. The
only benefits that appear to have been derived are the indirect ones
resulting from an increase in prices, and this has not been observed as
yet to have conspicuously aided the general predicament of the
tenant.</p>
<p>The high unemployment figures for Negroes are reflected in relief
rolls, where relief has been equally available to white and Negro <span
class="pagenum">740</span> families. In 1933 a census of persons on
relief showed 2,117,644 Negroes of all ages receiving aid. This was 17.8
per cent of all Negroes and 18.4 per cent of all cases on relief,
although Negroes are only 9.4 per cent of the population. The
percentages on relief varied by states from 4.3 per cent of the total
Negro population in Virginia to 36.6 per cent in Florida and 38.0 per
cent in Ohio. Although in general the Negroes have exceeded the whites
by a considerable margin in most states, the proportions are not always
an accurate index to Negro unemployment. In Mississippi, for example,
where the population is about evenly divided, and the Negroes admittedly
in greater economic need, there were 91,375 Negroes (9.0 per cent) and
136,339 whites (13.7 per cent) on relief.</p>

<p>The numbers on relief have been mounting in all sections since 1933
in both northern and southern areas, as the figures for selected cities
in 1934 indicate (Table I). It is obvious in the figures in Table I that
the relief administrators in urban centers have recognized the unequal
stress of unemployment on Negroes and have permitted a liberal margin in
relief. This was not so frequently the case in the earlier years of the
depression.</p>
<p>The administration of rural relief has been more erratic and
uncertain than in urban centers. Removed from the glare of public
criticism, the practice of the local administrators, who have been for
the most part identified with the tenants in the capacity of landlords,
has been determined largely by individual standards of fairness and
their notions of expediency. A complete analysis of the federal
relief<span class="pagenum">741</span>program in the state of Georgia,
by Dr. Arthur Raper of the Commission on Interracial Co-operation,
reveals some interesting tendencies. Taking the state as a whole, he
found three racial differentials: (1) a larger proportion of the white
than of the Negro population was on relief despite the fact that the
whites own practically all the land and all other productive properties
in the state, while the Negroes were chiefly the impoverished tenants;
(2) in over 80 per cent of the counties the amount spent upon whites per
person for direct relief exceeded the amount spent for the Negro; and
(3) with respect to certain forms of work-relief on public projects
there had been a serious disregard of the quota for Negroes, based upon
either population proportion or need.</p>
<p>In agriculture the emergency aid which has most frequently reached
the Negro small farmer, apart from direct relief, has been in the form
of feed and seed loans under the Federal Emergency Crop Production
Loans. These provided a source of small credit which, in samples of four
counties taken in 1933,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> averaged from $51.34 to $108.80.
Repayment of these loans has been high. Under the Farm Credit Act
production credit associations have recently been organized. Although
this service is just beginning and contemplates loan£ larger than $100,
the Negro farmers have not yet begun to use it adequately. The pattern
of Negro and white participation in associations is too new in southern
agricultural areas to make this an easy source of credit for the
Negroes, Moreover, the requirement of purchase of shares, and the cost
of legal assistance, are likewise a handicap even when lack of knowledge
of the existence of credit sources does not play an important part.</p>
<p>Through the emergency crop loans the cost of ordinary commercial
credit to Negro farmers has been reduced from 12 to 40 per cent, and
there has been the advantage of impersonal advice on crop production, In
the judgment of county agents in close touch with these farmers these
crop loans have been the major sources of credit—and the most
satisfactory. If, as it is contemplated, the services will <span
class="pagenum">742</span>eventually be replaced by the production
credit associations, there is uncertainty ahead for the small Negro
farmer.</p>
<p>Under the Public Works Administration several wings of the service
reached the Negroes. The public works projects have employed large
numbers of unskilled workers, both white and Negro. The housing program,
when joined to the highly desirable slum clearance program, met squarely
and unavoidably an old problem of Negro residence areas in cities North
and South. The very first of the projects for which ground was broken by
the Administration was a Negro project in Atlanta, in the shadow of
Atlanta University. Other such developments are under way or planned in
Nashville, New Orleans, Detroit, Chicago, and Cleveland, and hoped for
in several other cities.</p>
<p>The Tennessee Valley Authority has been one of the most important
single programs projected in the recovery effort. In this area which
comprises most of Tennessee and parts of six other states, are 268,048
Negroes, or 10.2 per cent of the total population. The social planning
experiment, which accompanies the vast engineering project, gives to it
extraordinary significance. At Norris Dam, one of the first major
developments, Negroes were included in the work, chiefly unskilled, to
the extent of their proportion in the population of the area from which
workers generally were drawn. Objection was raised in some quarters to
their sharing the model community of Norris. In the vicinity of Wheeler
and Pickwick Landing dams, however, where their population proportion of
the area is 20.0 per cent, they have constituted as much as 30 per cent
of the workers. The number of skilled workers, at first small, has been
increasing, and the personnel program, under an exceptionally
well-trained Negro, is regarded as one of the most outstanding in the
entire program. There has been Negro representation in the social
researches basic to the planning of programs for the area.</p>
<p>The Civilian Conservation Corps began with an injunction against
discrimination. However, many of the state quotas were nearly completed
before the Negroes were fully aware of this service. Some Negroes are in
mixed camps, but in small numbers, in the northern states. In the border
and southern states and in some of the northern states, the camps are
separate. In September, 1934, there were 17,071 Negroes in all CCC
camps.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">743</span>The Civil Works Administration in
northern and southern areas has been a source of emergency employment
for Negroes under the classification of unskilled work. The complaints,
most often justifiable, have deplored the neglect of Negro skilled and
clerical workers. There is a pronounced objection in the cities of the
South to the use of Negroes in skilled positions. In the selection of
CWA projects little attempt is evident to convert the service to
projects beneficial to Negro communities or institutions. The
Subsistence Homestead Division has had Negro personnel on its general
staff, and has seriously studied the possibilities of Negro
developments. Bogged for months in the segregation issue, it finally
settled on three sites in the South.</p>
<p>It is too short a period, since 1929, for the usual indexes of social
change to register. Mortality, literacy, morbidity, and crime
statistics, even if fully available, would scarcely be significant yet.
The impossibility of maintaining a decent living standard is implicit
not only in the unemployed numbers but in the drastically reduced
earnings of those partly and even wholly employed. The Director of the
Federal Emergency Relief Administration announced in January that there
were 21,000,000 persons on federal relief. If the 1933 Negro percentage
of 18.4 persons on relief is used, there are at present 3,864,000
Negroes receiving aid from the government. It was a fact marked by
social workers prior to the depression that Negroes were less than their
expected quota in application for relief. The long-continued necessity
for aid holds the danger of making chronic dependents of many of
them.</p>
<p>One possible counteracting feature has been noted in the salutary
effects of the standards for relief in the larger cities. This has at
times been higher than the families normally sustained for themselves.
The selection of food has tended to give a better balance to the diet
and relieve in some measure the problem of malnutrition. The advice of
relief visitors has frequently been helpful, and essential medical
attention has been regarded as a part of the routine of relief.</p>
<p>The restriction on child labor in the National Recovery Act, although
not generally enforced, nevertheless helped accelerate the Negro
enrolment in elementary schools. These increases came, how<span
class="pagenum">744</span> ever, at the point of drastic retrenchments
in public school expenditures by counties. Dr. N. C. Newbold, Director
of the Division of Negro Education in North Carolina,<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
attempted late in 1932 to learn from the 18 southern states with
separate schools the extent to which they had been affected by the
depression. Building operations had been stopped; salaries had been
reduced in some states, for Negroes more in some, and less than whites
in others; and enrolment had increased generally. The morale of the
teachers universally was praised. The following year school terms were
shortened and many teachers paid in scrip. In 1934 federal aid had to
come more directly to the rescue of the schools, to permit the
completion of a normal school year.</p>
<p>It has been variously noted by writers that race relations have
improved under an economic distress which was common to all groups, and
that manifestations of racial friction have increased through the
competition for fewer jobs. Both are true, the differences in expression
following generally the traditional patterns of relations, and the
character of the new stresses. Professor Guy B. Johnson of the
University of North Carolina<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> notes a lessening of
racial tension in his state. White business has been more conscious of
the Negro consumer, with a corresponding change in the formal attitudes.
Although it has been suggested that the exigencies of the depression are
“driving the races together” he warns that these changes should not be
taken wholly as a sign of a new day in race relations. The increase in
the number and brutality of lynchings in recent years has been charged
to increased economic competition. The tragic irony of the situation is
the historical feud between white and black workers, so heavily charged
with bitterness and contempt that it continues to confuse race with
status, and wastes the energies demanded for economic reconstruction on
destructive envy and combat.</p>
<p>This conflict has been sensed by the Communists, who have taken
occasion to proselyte among the restless Negro workers, and with <span
class="pagenum">745</span>some success. Making common cause they have
linked their interests and philosophy with the plight of the Negro
workers and have made effective demonstrations. In Chicago they have
protested and physically thwarted rent evictions of Negroes. They have
led militant protest groups to relief agencies and dramatized the common
interests of workers, white and black. In Birmingham, Alabama, they have
given great alarm to the city by their doctrines and activities. The
wary Negroes have sympathized with the principles which took more notice
of their plight than those of other political groups, but with a
moderate amount of actual membership. Led by economic liberals chiefly,
white and Negro share-croppers in northern Alabama in 1933, and in
Arkansas in 1934 and 1935, have challenged the long exploitative
authority of the planters. The actual number involved is small, but the
boldness of this new challenge of desperation has drawn the startled
attention of the rural South,</p>
<p>It is not unlikely that the continued accentuation of the inherent
evils of the tenant system, by the sheer operation of the system itself,
will eventually compel the enactment of comprehensive and drastic
legislation to correct it, as a means of saving southern agriculture
itself.</p>
