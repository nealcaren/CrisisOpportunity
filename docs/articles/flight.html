<p><span class="pagenum">272</span> Desire for more wages and more
regular wages, for better social treatment, improved cultural
surroundings; the hysteria of a mass movement; simple curiosity and
desire for travel and adventure, and free railroad tickets, all have
played their part in the divorcement of the southern Negro from the land
of his birth.</p>
<p>Reasons are one thing; motives another. The former with all persons
are likely to be merely a rationalization of behavior, while the latter
usually play first role in inspiring the behavior.</p>
<p>All Negroes (no more than all whites) are not uniformly sensitive to
their social environment. And altho emphasis upon the pernicious nature
of the social environment of southern Negroes should and doubtless will
have the effect of improving it, such emphasis is apt to obscure what
seem to be even more vital issues and more substantial elements of Negro
character. After all, it means more that the Negroes who left the South
were motivated more by the desire to improve their economic status than
by fear of being manhandled by unfriendly whites. The one is a symptom
of wholesome and substantial life purpose; the other, the symptom of a
fugitive in-courageous opportunism.</p>
<p>Persecution plays its part—a considerable one. But when the whole of
the migration of southern Negroes is considered, this part seems to be
limited. It is indeed more likely that Negroes, like all others with a
spark of ambition and self-interest, have been deserting soil which
cannot yield returns in proportion to their population increase. The
Census of 1920 indicated that the rate of Negro increase declined <span
class="pagenum">273</span> from 18.0 for the decade 1890-1900, to 11.2
for the next, and to 6.5 for the last. This does not mean that fewer
children are being born, for actually more Negro than white babies per
family are being born, but that more of them are dying. This desertion
of the soil has taken three distinct directions: (a) urbanization—a
species of migration; (b) quest for more productive lands; (c)
transplantation to industrial communities, practically all of which are
in the North. During the past thirty years, 1890-1920, there lias been
an increase in the rural population of 896,124 Negroes as compared with
2,078,331 for cities. The urban increase has been just about 100 per
cent as rapid as the rural. In 1890, 19.8 per cent of the Negro
population lived in cities; in 1920, this proportion grew to about 40
per cent. In the Southern States, between 1890-1900, the rural
population increased 13.6 per cent, and between 1910 and 1920 it
actually decreased 3.3 per cent. The Negro population increase in
southern cities, considered as a whole, has been greater than the
increase in the North, considered as a whole, despite the half-million
added during the last decade. Here, of course, is the economic factor at
work, hand in hand, with greater mobility, increased transportation,
restlessness and the monotony and uncertainty of agricultural life ever
against the allurements of the city.</p>
<p>The greatest inter-state movements of southern Negroes have been
further South and West. In 1910, 52.3 per cent of the migration from
Southern States was to the area west of the Mississippi; while in 1920,
after the tremendous migration to the North, 42.9 per cent were living
in the Southwestern States as compared with 42.2 per cent living in the
North and West. For 130 years the center of the Negro population moved
steadily some 478 miles toward the southwest—–from Dinwiddie county Va.,
to northern Alabama.</p>
<p>This shifting is further evident in the insta<span
class="pageum">274</span>bility of Negro population in southern
counties. Between 1900 and 1910, for example, 33.5 per cent of the
counties increased rapidly, 31.1 increased at a rate above the average,
while only 3.4 per cent showed an actual decrease, and 9.8 per cent an
average increase equivalent to the total increase of the section. In
1879 there was a migration, similar to the one which we now experience,
to Kansas. This followed a depression in 1878. Some 60,000 Negroes left.
In 1888-1889, there was a similar movement to Arkansas, which carried
35,003 Negroes. Arkansas for example, gained, between 1900-1910, 105,516
Negroes, the largest net gain of any state north or south; Oklahoma
gained 85,062; and Texas, 19,821; while all the eastern, southern and
central states suffered a loss. The counties of most rapid increase in
the South between 1910 and 1920 were those south of the region of
maximum Negro population density in 1910.</p>
<p>It is further significant here that the white populations have been
showing in general outline the same trend of mobility as the Negroes.
For example, their rate of mobility was 20 per cent as compared with 16
per cent for the Negroes and they also have left the counties deserted
by Negroes, taking the same direction of migration.</p>
<p>Had persecution been the dominant and original stimulus, the
direction of Negroes during the sixty years following emancipation would
have been north instead of further south.</p>
<p>As a working test, a rough correlation was made between counties of
the South in which lynchings had occurred during the thirty year period
1888-1918 and the migration from and to these counties.</p>
<p>Of ten Georgia counties, in which five or more lynchings occurred,
the Negro population increased in five. Of the other five, in which the
Negro population decreased, there was a corresponding decrease in the
white population in three, and an increase in the other two considerably
less than the average. To use one example,in Montgomery County, in which
five lynchings occurred, the Negro population decreased from 7,310 to
4,348 and the white population from 12,328 to 4,768. If this were a
measure of persecution, the whites are the greater victims.</p>
<p>In Jasper County, Ga., there were nine lynchings, the largest number
for any county of the state in thirty years. The Negro population
actually increased in this county between 1890 to 1920, while the white
population during 1900 and 1910 actually decreased.</p>
<p>Or to take the State of Texas. Of the six counties with five or more
lynchings, the Negro population increased in four and decreased in two.
Of the two in which there was a Negro decrease, there was a
corresponding but more serious decrease in the white population. In
Waller County, the Negro population decreased from 6,712 in 1910 to
4,967 in 1920; the white population decreased from 6,375 in 1900 to
5,426 in 1910 and to 4,082 in 1920. In Harrison County, with the largest
number of lynchings (16), the Negro population showed a similar increase
from 13,544 to 15,639.</p>
<p>In the State of Alabama, Jefferson County, with ten lynchings,
increased from 90,617 in 1910 to 130,211 in 1920—the largest recorded
increase in any county; Dallas County, with the largest number of
lynchings (19), lost only 1,246 Negroes, while Sumter, with no lynchings
at all, lost 3,491.</p>
<p>In spite of a considerable progress by Negroes, the great bulk of
this population is in an almost hopeless struggle against feudalism. In
four of the most congested Southern States: Georgia, Alabama,
Mississippi, Louisiana, containing 37,405,760 Negroes or over 36 per
cent of all the Negroes in the country, 83.3 per cent of them are
landless. The per cent of tenant farmers instead of changing over into
owners actually increased in practically every Southern State during the
past decade, while the per cent of owners decreased. Altho this was to
some extent true of white farmers, the proportion among Negroes was just
twice as great. The large plantation owners it seems are gradually
taking over the land, thus reducing tenants, white and colored, to a
state of unrelieved and helpless peasantry.</p>
<p>Cotton is a peculiar crop. Its nurture requires about seven times as
many hands as other crops and only then for certain periods of the year.
It does not yield readily to labor saving devices. It can be grown
profitably only with cheap labor, and plenty of it, and Negroes have
been the South’s cheap labor. Immigrants are not welcomed because of
their tendency and frequent ability in time to purchase their own plots
of ground. As a matter of fact, small white tenants are not as desirable
in the plantation scheme as Negroes; and if Negroes persist in leaving,
the plantation system itself, an anomaly in this country and notoriously
unstable, is doomed.</p>
<p>Knowing just why Negroes left the South and what they were looking
for will carry one further toward making their adjustment easier. The
thought of flight from persecution excites little sympathy either from
the practical employer or the northern white population among whom these
Negroes will hereafter live. Every man who runs is not a good worker and
from the point of view of the Negroes who have come, they cannot sustain
themselves long on sympathy. It is indeed not unthinkable that the high
mortality so conspicuous in the abnormally reduced rate of Negro
increase will be strikingly affected by the migration. The relief of
overpopulation in certain counties of the South will undoubtedly give
each Negro child born a better chance for survival, while, on the other
hand, the presence of Negroes in cities exposes them to health education
and sanitary regulations. The death rate of Negroes in northern cities,
in spite of the fact that migrations there are principally of adults to
whom death is more imminent, is not as great as in most of the Negro
counties of the South.</p>
