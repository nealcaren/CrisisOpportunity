<p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract: </strong>Contact between a
dominant group and a subordinate group results, through miscegenation,
in a third group midway between the two parent-stocks. This third group
seeks identification with the dominant group, although the latter may
deny such identification. At the same time, because of the
characteristics identifying it with the dominant group, it protests
against identification with the subordinate group, to which it holds
itself superior, and it achieves a status much above that occupied by
the subordinate parent-group. This formula of race, which is descriptive
of many situations, may be applied with exactitude to two racial islands
in America, the Creoles and the Cajuns, both in Alabama. Although quite
different in social traits and qualities—in industry, in thrift and
cleanliness, in social organization, in intellectual ability, in
culture—these two groups are alike in having to occupy distinctive
social positions, on the one hand disclaimed by their white
parent-groups and on the other hand themselves disclaiming their Negro
parents. They equally demonstrate the applicability of the formula of
race in America.</p>



<h2 id="i">I</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum">552</span> Recent speculations regarding race
have received the benefit of a theoretical structure, or mold, which
serves as a highly useful formula in classifying modes of racial contact
and in predicting the course of future interracial developments. This
formula, the contribution of such sociologists as Park and Reuter, among
others, may be simplified as follows: Given a dominant race A,
establishing contact with a subordinate race B, there tends to develop
through miscegenation an intermediate group C, midway between the two
parent-stocks. The new group, C, possessing as it does many of the
physical characteristics of the dominant group A, will seek
identification with the superior group in its thinking and social
intercourse. Although this equality of exchange may be denied the hybrid
group by the superior parent-stock, the sense of superiority inherent in
the hybrid group because of those characteristics which ally it with
group A, as well as a partial recognition of such superiority to the
subordinate group B by the superior half of the hybrid’s progenitors,
serve as an advantage in propelling the newer group forward to a status
far superior to that occupied by the subordinate parent-group. In many
instances this marginal situation aids in producing individuals of
exceptional ability, even in comparison with types <span
class="pagenum">553</span> produced by the dominant group, which lacks
the peculiar stimulation afforded by the intermediate position of group
C.</p>
<p>In the process of miscegenation, of course, the members of the
dominant group never anticipate social acceptance while engaged in
giving their physical traits to their bastard offspring. That problem,
unfortunately, always arises when individuals are found with mixed blood
who clamor for social acceptance. The usual result has been that the
dominant group, after destroying the purity of both parent-stocks,
blandly hoists the bars against these left-handed children in the sacred
name of racial purity. The Anglo-Saxon Purity League, and other
creations of the “Nordic delusion,” are instances of this untimely
attention to the barn door after the horse has fled.</p>
<p>The South Europeans have been more catholic in this respect. The
Gaul, or the Spaniard, and the colonist among Latin peoples generally,
has in the past found little to choose between his curly-haired son by
an aboriginal mother and his other curly-haired son by the wife of his
own people. But the Anglo-Saxon tradition is as dominant in this field
of racial hybridization as it is in the field of colonial penetration,
and for the same reason‚—ts more extensive scope. There are as many
obvious instances of the formula and its workings as there are
situations involving contact of Europeans with native peoples. Better
known than others, perhaps, are the Sino-European of the Pacific Orient,
the Hindu half-breeds, dear to fiction and fable, and the hybrid peoples
created in this country by contact of whites and American Indians. Who
has not heard the musical comedy, or read the short-story, or seen the
cinema where there is put forth the sad fate of the beautiful half-breed
maiden expiring in devoted agony, after laying down her life to foil the
ugly half-breed villain in order that her pure-bred lover and his
equally pure-bred white mate might live happily ever after?</p>
<p>Much smoke, some fire; the theme could not be so popular if it had no
basis in fact. One has but to turn to the neighboring islands of the
Caribbean to find this tragi-comedy of racial hybridization in full
swing today. In Haiti there is, and always has been, a clean-cut
cleavage between whites, blacks, and mulatto intermediates, with the
exception of the period initiated by the massacre of the <span
class="pagenum">554</span> early French plantation-owners and brought to
a conclusion by the intervention of the marines. In Jamaica it exists
today, as anyone familiar with the customs of that island or the
fulminations of Marcus Garvey can testify. In South Africa one can point
to the Reho-bother Bastaards, painstakingly described by Fischer, or to
the “colored‚” peoples of the cape as distinctly separated in law and
custom from the “natives.”</p>
<p>In our own United States, the land of perfect liberty, where all men
are created equal, the situation assuredly gives pause in the
application of the formula. There is no ripple of amusement or disbelief
from an audience when a speaker who looks like the latest edition of
Wendell Phillips‚ “blue-eyed Anglo-Saxon‚” passionately declaims upon‚
“the necessity that all of us black men in America and the world stand
together!” For the speaker means a very definite thing, if not exactly
what he says, and his audience knows it. Time was when there were
blue-vein societies and other organizations of like ilk among Negroes in
this country, but they seem largely to have disintegrated, owing to two
happy chances of fortune. The first has been that those who were so much
like the dominant group as to demand and desire full fellowship to the
extent of seclusion from the subordinate group have in great part folded
their tents and crept quietly into the ranks of the whites, with no more
flurry about it. The other fortunate thing has been the unyielding
refusal of the dominant group to accept any of its hybrid progeny, if
known as such, no matter how highly infused with the superior strain,
into its domestic councils. In this country the public acceptance of the
dictum of the sheriff in <em>Show-Boat</em>‚—“One drop of nigger blood
makes you a nigger!”—has done countless good for the Negro, as it has
served to focus his energies and that of all his potential leaders upon
the immediate task of racial survival. There is here no widespread
wasting of energies or efforts on the creation and maintenance of an
intermediate group.</p>
<p>Yet the formula may aptly be applied to America, land though it be of
variation from the expected social norm. If the theoretical implications
of the entire situation were not enough to prove it, there are certain
points where its full weight may be applied with exactitude. Leaving out
of account the instances more highly ex<span
class="pagneum">555</span>ploited by the fictioneers and
sentimentalists, and even our friends the sociologists, the writer has
recently come upon two isolated racial islands which demonstrate as in a
microcosm all of the major problems of race in the country at large.</p>
<h2 id="ii">II</h2>
<p>Baldwin County, Alabama, is the seat of the first of these racial
islands. The county itself presents one of the most remarkable
hodgepodges conceivable even in the America in which we live. There is a
large Greek colony, communistic in structure, located at Loxley. There
are French, Polish, Italian, Scandinavian, German, Bohemian, and
Croatian colonies. Besides these foreign-language groups, there are two
religious colonies in a settlement of Quakers near Fairhope and another
of Amish Mennonites, a sect of the Hooker Mennonites. The ever present
Negro is here as tenant, small-farm-owner, and laborer in the numerous
turpentine and naval-store plants in the woodlands and swamps.</p>
<p>At Fairhope is the well-known Single Tax Colony, made prosperous by
intelligence as well as by a fortunate rise in real-estate values
facilitated by the development of the Gulf Coast region and the recent
construction of the Cochrane Bridge across Mobile Bay. Also located in
this little town which resembles Indiana more than Alabama is the
Organic School, where the devoted disciples of Marietta Johnson pursue
the ideal of a “free‚” school with a zeal found only in idealists wedded
to a novel idea.</p>
<p>To reach the home of the peculiar racial group in question, one
leaves the Old Spanish Trail at the eastern head of the Cochrane Bridge,
and drives south through Fairhope along Mobile Bay. Ten or fifteen miles
beyond is the pleasant little village of Magnolia Springs, and one is in
the sandy Gulf Coast soil where these people have their farms and
community life. They call themselves “Creoles‚” and their white
neighbors qualify the term by calling them “Nigger Creoles.” The
question of Negro blood has long been a sensitive spot with the Creole
population of Louisiana and other southern states, but in Baldwin County
it means only one thing to the dominant white class: some degree of
Negro extraction.</p>
<p>The very houses announce a different community. They are <span
class="pagenum">556</span> small and weather-beaten, but with none of
the ugly rawness characteristic of the newer cottages of white
farm-owners, or the destitution usually noticeable in the Negro
plantation cabins. Picket fences, whitewashed and prim, surround the
yards, which are neat and orderly. The farm land around shows evidence
of careful tillage.</p>
<p>Our first stop was to inquire at a farmhouse as to the road to take
to reach the nearest Creole school. Directions were crisp and exact. The
women who directed us, an elderly woman and a girl, were typical of all
the women we saw in this community, with brown skins, black hair, and
pleasant features. They spoke with the dialect of the southern white
lowlander, and with the same inflection and intonation.</p>
<p>A stop at a little crossroads store where the young Creole clerk
volunteered more information led us still farther into the intricacies
of life among the Magnolia Springs Creoles. The clerk was a small man
whose complexion had a hint of reddish brown, and he was one of the few
men in the community who bore a French family name. He claimed to be the
great-grandson of an officer in Napoleon’s Grande Armée. He had come to
the Baldwin County community from across the bay. He gave as his reason
the decay of the Creole community in Mobile County, and stated that this
disintegration was almost complete.</p>
<p>I was able to visit this other Creole community in Mobile County, a
community located on Mon Louis Island some fifteen miles south of
Mobile. There the decomposition of the system was very evident,
noticeable in an increasing number of intermarriages with those who
claimed no other race than Negro, and by the acceptance of teachers
known to be Negroes if they were sufficiently light in complexion to
“pass” for Creoles, and if they were good Catholics. The Baldwin County
Creoles, we were told, would never accept a Negro teacher, Catholic or
not. One innocent young man had been sent to the Creole community as a
teacher some years in the past, only to be forced to leave precipitously
soon after his appearance at the schoolhouse. For all this, it is a fact
that forty or fifty years ago the Creoles of Baldwin County had Negro
teachers and made no objection. Apparently this indicates that the
struggle for sur<span class="pagenum">557</span>vival has grown more
acute, and outside pressure has forced them to a greater group
consciousness as a survival measure.</p>
<p>The first Creole school was an ordinary building located near a small
Catholic chapel. The teacher was a young white man who looked at me
speculatively as we approached. As we were inspecting the Negro schools
of the county, and the county superintendent had listed the Creole
schools among this number, the white member of our party suggested that
I should stay at this school while he went on to the next one to
administer the tests we were using as a means of discovering pupil
achievement. The teacher was clearly at a loss. At first hand he was
unable to determine with which group I was to be classified, and he was
at some pains not to insult me if I were a Creole. Finally, he came
bluntly to the point.</p>
<p>“What do you call yourself?”</p>
<p>In some surprise I hastened to give what I thought was the obvious
answer: “Why, I’m a Negro.”</p>
<p>The need for hedging was gone. “Well, I’ll tell you; of course I’m
not prejudiced, but if some of these Creoles heard that a nigger was up
here giving tests to their children, I don’t know what would
happen.”</p>
<p>There is, perhaps, little need to add that it was decided that the
white member of the party should administer tests at both schools.</p>
<p>The children proved to be remarkably alert. They scored above the
standards expected even of white children of their age and
classification, on the basis of nation-wide standards. These standards
are based on the performance of children representative of urban as well
as of rural systems, and rural children generally may be expected to
score below these standards. The contrast in their work was all the more
striking because of long months spent in handling classrooms of
plantation Negro children, whose preparation for the type of response
called for by the tests is especially poor.</p>
<p>In the accompanying figure the results of tests given to Creoles,
Negroes, and Cajuns is graphically displayed, in comparison with the
national standards based on pupil performance. With the exception of the
third grade, where the difference was but slight, the Creole children
exceeded the national standards for each grade. <span
class="pagenum">558</span> for the seventh and eighth grades were
unobtainable because the Creole schools did not have these grades.</p>

<p>Why are these children superior? They have excellent teachers, but
these can hardly be judged to be better than those in the large white
consolidated schools in the county. The fact that both schools are small
should, with the fact that the clientele is altogether rural, militate
against superior performance. The significant fact is that with all of
these negative conditions which ordinarily would be ex<span
class="pagenum">559</span>pected to result in a low score for the
children they make an exceptional score.</p>
<p>In color, the children ranged from shades of brown to white. The
darkest of the children could have found entrée into more cosmopolitan
circles where the presence of dark South Europeans is usual. Children
may be observed attending white schools in Mobile, just across the bay,
who are every whit as dark in complexion, and whose hair is as curly as
is typical of the Creole children. There was a startling similarity in
their physiognomies, regardless of the wide variations in color.</p>
<p>From the first school we went on to the next and last Creole school.
Another white teacher, the wife of the man who presided over the other
school, welcomed us into her neat room, looking for all the world like a
little Hoosier schoolhouse set down in southern Alabama. From the
statements of our guides, as well as the opinions of the male teacher,
we had expected to find a group much different from the first group, for
the second school was reputed to be the more aristocratic of the two.
There prevailed even in this little community of some two hundred
families a cleavage along lines of color, and while the presence of
darker children, we had been told, was tolerated, it was pre-eminently a
school for the Creole elite, where distinction was based on lightness of
complexion. To the eye of the uninitiated, no such cleavage was evident.
The same blue eyes, brown skins, flaxen hair, curly hair, and all other
combinations seen at the first school were present here. The distinction
is one made largely by the heads of the families which control the two
schools. It would be very easy for these people to have a well-equipped
central school to take the place of the two temporary structures now
used. Two things prevent. In the first place, they are afraid to
consolidate the schools and accept state aid because this might place
them under the control of the county superintendent even more definitely
than they now are, and that functionary could then assign Negro teachers
to their school. In the second place, the lighter Creoles of the second
school’s trustee board will not agree to send their children to the
other school where the members of two or three darker families are
represented on the trustee board.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">560</span> This situation results in some
interesting developments. Children living within a stone’s throw of the
first school drive five miles past it to attend the other school. Often,
we are told, a family in which a light complexion predominates will
bring into the world a child darker than its parents or the other
children in the family. The child so unfortunate occupies a different
position in the household. One father had a son much darker than
himself. When he left the Creole community he passed his son off as his
chauffeur, and so rose superior to the barriers of race in his own
case.</p>
<p>The children in the second school were as able as in the first. Again
one must credit the efficiency of a good teacher. There are those, of
course, who would prefer to explain the superiority of these Creole
children on the basis of their white blood. But they are superior to
white children, and the situation existing with regard to the ability of
children in the other racial island visited does not sustain this
impression.</p>
<p>All of these Creoles are Catholics, and staunch believers. They feel
themselves immeasurably superior to the “turpentine niggers‚” around
them, and so they are in many ways. They are not allowed to enter the
white schools, and so their education is confined to the sixth grade of
the local schools. They could send their children to the Negro high
school for Baldwin County, located only twenty miles away at Daphne; but
no Creole would lower himself by allowing his child to go to school with
“niggers.” As a result, they are completely cut off from outside
association, and their persistence for some time to come seems to be
guaranteed by their inability, on the one hand, to enter into another
world, and their refusal, on the other, to assimilate with the Negro
group.</p>
<p>At community dances and social affairs white men are welcomed
readily, and the results for continued miscegenation are obvious. In the
disintegrating Mobile County community the decay had reached the point
where the young men were breaking away, leaving behind only women,
children, and the elderly folk of the tribe. There were in the latter
community several notorious cases of concubinage, cases of which existed
but were not so openly arrived at in the Baldwin County Creole
community.</p>
<p>These “Creoles‚” are in many ways an amusing people, when one <span
class="pagenum">561</span> considers the intertribal prejudices and
ideas of race that bind them. Yet the humor with which they may be
viewed is more pathetic than ludicrous, for any observer interested in a
well-knit rural community can appreciate the struggle they have made and
are making for status. The level of their social and economic life is on
a higher plane than that of the tenant and laboring Negroes of this
rural countryside. If the Creoles allowed the bars they have put up to
be relaxed even temporarily the unique life of the community would be
gone forever. Now they are Creoles, with pride, and the heartening sense
of being a people with a tradition and a past. If they weaken they will
be only Negroes, and perhaps the community will be flooded by the
ignorant folk around them. There can be no doubt that there is a strain
of Negro blood in the community, however, although it is increasingly
attenuated, owing to their positive refusal of association with Negroes
and their partial acquiescence in miscegenation, so long as it is
conducted with whites.</p>
<p>There is a legend in the countryside that the community goes back in
its history to the days when the Spanish Main harbored numerous pirates
and freebooters in the little inlets along the Gulf Coast. A portion of
these Carib marauders, so the legend goes, maintained a rendezvous on
the eastern shore of Mobile Bay, where these people now live. There is a
little bay that bears the name of one of the largest families in the
community, and that name belonged to a distinguished member of the
piratical elect of the days of Jean Lafitte and his predecessors. To
this little Eden, so the story goes, the robbers of the sea brought
their spoils for division. Naturally, a considerable portion of these
rewards of piracy were in the nature of feminine consignments. Their
women were of all races: Negroes, Spanish, French, and English. The
hybridization begun in this way has produced the people here
described.</p>
<p>But for all this storied past, there is nothing romantic in the
attitude of the white people who are their neighbors. They look upon the
Creoles as a vile people who have violated, however unconsciously, the
dogma of race purity; and so they are despised and rejected of all good
Baldwin countians. Their future is uncertain. Perhaps they will
disappear in the course of a few years, like the Mobile County
communities whose decay the young Creole lament<span
class="pagenum">562</span>ed. When it crumbles, some members of it will
leave the country to be swallowed up in the whites, and the remainder
will submerge themselves in the toiling Negroes who are all around.
Until that time comes, however, this little spot will continue to be a
place where the workings of a tri-racial system may yet be observed.
Until the present it has been neglected by both the probing hands of the
sociologist and the sentimental fabrications of the short-story
agonizers. As they exist today, unmistakably hybrid though they be, they
are yet a peculiarly superior people.</p>
<h2 id="iii">III</h2>
<p>Across the swamps of the Tensas and Alabama rivers, now bridged by
the ten-mile causeway of the Cochrane Bridge, is the city of Mobile.
Thirty miles north of this old center of early French and Spanish
explorers are several detached and isolated communities of another
hybrid people who call themselves Cajuns. Those in Mobile County are
probably migrants from the main body of this people, which numbers
several thousand in Alabama alone. There are many others in the counties
which lie immediately to the north—Clark and Washington. In the latter
two counties their numbers are considerable enough to constitute a
difficult problem, necessitating the maintenance of a tri-racial system
of schools which is productive of every kind of administrative tangle
for harassed school officials. Whether the Cajuns of Alabama bear
kinship to those of Mississippi and Louisiana is a matter of question.
The word itself is a corruption of “Acadian‚” or “Arcadian” and their
derivation is claimed by the historians of Louisiana to be from those
French-Canadians dispossessed by the British in the eighteenth century
and immortalized by Longfellow. Not a single person could be found in
the Mobile County community, however, who knew of this origin, or
claimed it. They admit readily the racial heritage from the Indian, but
deny as strongly as the Creoles of Baldwin County the presence of any
“Negro taint.” A singular thing is that not a single family as
represented in the Mobile County community bears a name indicating Latin
derivation. Family names are all good old Scotch-Irish-English
patronymics; a school roll showed such family names as Smith, Terry,
Jones, and Carter.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">563</span> Aside from their common status as
intermediary racial groups, there is little between the Creoles mid
Cajuns to indicate any relationship. The Cajuns are almost universally
Baptists or Methodists, although, as a matter of fact, they are by no
means enthusiastic devotees of these sects.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is difficult to find anything about which the Cajuns grow
enthusiastic. The churches are maintained only as missions, and by
outside mission boards. There is certainly no riper field in America for
missionary endeavor. The neat houses and lots characteristic of the
Creole community in Baldwin County are replaced in the Cajun community
by wretched cabins, giving an impression of squalor more depressing than
can be seen in any Negro cabin in that part of the county. On every tiny
veranda women sit in idleness while untidy, half-clad children play in
the sunlight. The women are rouged vividly, regardless of age, and the
artificial color of their faces contrasts oddly with the general neglect
attending their costumes and the background furnished by the wild and
tangled countryside around.</p>
<p>We entered a school which, we were told by a bedizened old woman who
sat calmly smoking a pipe on the veranda of a nearby cabin, was also the
local Methodist church. With the exception of Rosenwald-built schools,
Negro schoolhouses in Alabama are generally decrepit, but in cases which
occur frequently the school is taught in a church which is always a
substantially sealed building. The Cajun church-schoolhouse, however,
was a sad affair. The ceiling was furnished by the shingled roof, and it
was in such disrepair that numerous little “tents of blue” appeared
through the cracks where shingles had been. The single weather-beaten
walls were streaked with large cracks, and the rough board floors showed
gaping holes that called for some little care in walking around the
room. In such a building as this ventilation would never be a problem
for the teacher, if fresh air was the only thing needed. A little heater
stood in one comer, but its utility in even moderately cold weather was
doubtful. The condition of the building was significant because in the
South the church is usually a reflection of the level of community
enterprise in rural areas. Many Negro schoolhouses are in a condition as
poor as this Cajun school, but one will rarely if <span
class="pagenum">564</span> ever find in the entire countryside so
ramshackle a structure used by Negroes as a church.</p>
<p>The children were unkempt and remarkably rude. Where the Creoles of
Baldwin County had used the dialect of the better-class whites, these
Cajun children used a lingo which had none of the subtle, softened
graces of elision characteristic of the Negro field hand, but with all
of the nasalities of “poor white trash.” Their stupidity was a little
shocking, even to one accustomed to backward children. We have noted how
they compared with the Negro children and the Creoles, by grades. When
it is remembered further that the Cajun children averaged a year
over-age even when compared with the Negro school children, who were far
above normal age levels for their respective grades, their poor showing
becomes more evident.</p>
<p>During a lull in the inspection one of the larger boys—a
frecklefaced, red-haired youngster who looked akin to the tribe of Huck
Finn—was asked, “What do you people call yourself?”</p>
<p>“We’se Cajuns, we is. We’se Injuns an’ white folks, all mixed up. We
ain’t never had no nigger blood in us.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but why do you call yourself by that name? Where does ‘Cajun’
come from, and what does it mean?”</p>
<p>“We’uns don’t know.” But he did know that he had no “nigger” blood in
him, although a little girl sat in the next seat whose crimped hair was
never inherited from the noble Red Man.</p>
<p>In addition to the size and condition of rural churches, an unfailing
index to the status of a rural community may be found in the graveyards.
The burial plot attached to this church was unfenced, and the only signs
to show the resting places of the Cajuns’ dear departed consisted of
little mounds, with here and there a broken pitcher or half-filled
medicine bottle, the label long since worn off by the elements. There
was not a single gravestone or board in the plot. Even the pieces of
broken china, ever present in the typical Negro burial ground as
mementos of the last struggle for life and the faithful care of the
weeping relicts, were indeed fragmentary here. The thicket in which the
plot was located did serve some utilitarian purpose, however, for in the
absence of conveniences the <span class="pagenum">565</span> children
had open and shameless recourse to the privacy the graves of their
ancestors afforded.</p>
<p>In complexion the children ran all shades on the scale from brown to
white, as in the case of the Creole children. However, there was no
homogeneity of feature such as that which seemed to brand the members of
the little Creole community as akin, regardless of a difference in
complexion. There were some small children who might have been taken
from the backs of Indian squaws on the plains, but the general
impression was one of a bewildering variety of all sorts of racial
admixture, with Negroid features accompanying blue eyes and flaxen hair,
ranging to classic features framed by a mop of unruly hair shading a
dark skin.</p>
<p>Inquiry revealed the fact that but few of the Cajuns own their land.
They live in the barren hill country where eight dollars an acre is a
high price for land which has been cut over for timber and will grow
sparse upland cotton and enough sweet potatoes to keep a family alive
for a year.</p>
<p>Like the Creoles of Baldwin County, they are barred from all social
intercourse with the whites, and refuse to ally themselves with the
Negroes. In the case of the Cajuns, however, this works entirely to
their disadvantage, for while the Negroes hate the Creoles for their
superior attitude, they merely despise the Cajuns. They feel that they
are far above these hill people, for even the poorest Negro tenant has a
share in a strong community life, goes to church regularly, and takes
some pride in his personal appearance and that of his children. The most
poverty-stricken of these Negro tenants in the surrounding countryside
will refer with a delicious sense of superiority and scorn to “them
dirty Cajuns;” and the Creoles, when asked if they were a kindred people
to their fellow-hybrids of Mobile County, were quick to deny the
slander.</p>
<p>The Cajuns will not now accept Negro teachers, although in times past
they made no bones over accepting women who were of light complexion.
Their schools, however, are listed officially with the Negro schools.
The surrounding whites object to white women going into their community
to teach, the objection, as one native informed me, being due to the
fact that there had occurred several <span class="pagenum">566</span>
cases where these white teachers had married Cajuns, thus violating the
code of racial purity.</p>
<p>As the backwoods fastnesses of the Cajuns are gradually penetrated
from year to year by good roads and other agencies of extra-world
contacts, their group is undergoing a rapid process of decay, as with
the Creoles of Mobile County who are now almost a thing of the past. In
these Cajun communities where the families are brought in open contact
with the white world the demoralization seems to be even more thorough.
The Creoles simply disappear, while echoes of the Cajuns linger on in
tales of licentious conduct, concubinage with both white and black men,
and altogether a lingering survival of the disorganization now patent in
the community, but even more raw and unpleasant when exposed to the
probing of forces from two sides.</p>
<h2 id="iv">IV</h2>
<p>After the Creole and Cajun communities it is something of a relief to
find one‚Äôs self back in Mobile, in a world where a bi-racial situation
is provocative of enough perplexities for the ordinary man. In this safe
haven of comparative security, where I know every Negro as a potential
friend and every white man, if not as a potential enemy, at least as a
person of whose gestures I must take wary cognizance, it is instructive
to reflect that thirty miles from this city, in opposite directions, are
to be found two little racial islands that mirror the larger whole in
many ways, yet with a concentrated complexity difficult to imagine aside
from reality. Here in this little thirty-mile circle are two hybrid
groups, one firm, industrious, thrifty, clean, and intelligent, bound
together with the strong discipline of Mother Church, yet shot through
with distinctions as vital to them as those which separate me from other
men in this city. The other hybrid group is almost completely
disorganized, its people thriftless, untidy in person and in their
homes, unintelligent, without benefit of clergy except for a feeble
mission effort for which they have no enthusiasm and from which they
gain little in the way of either religious consolation or social
unity.</p>
<p>How can we explain the riddle? Manifestly the tonic qualities of the
white blood, so boasted in the past as an explanation of progress, has
no right to be claimed as the basic factor here. It is absurd <span
class="pagenum">567</span> to say that the Baldwin County Creoles are
superior because they have so much white blood, for the Cajuns are as
much favored or handicapped by this precious elixir as the former
people. At any rate, these islands show that the formula of race may be
demonstrated even in the present in this country. The difference between
these two groups in social progress may be due to their religion, and
its venerable tradition, or lack of it. It may be due to a strong sense
of group solidarity fostered by this religious bond, lacking in one
group as it clearly is. Whatever the explanation, certainly one needs
some other explanation than that of hereditary racial superiority or
inferiority to account for the vast social distance that separates these
two racial islands.</p>
