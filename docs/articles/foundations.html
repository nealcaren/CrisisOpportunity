<p><span class="pagenum">468</span> The apologetic school of American
race relations considers the social distance<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
between white and black Americans as conforming to a natural order of
pre-ordained and inescapable physical, mental and moral differences
between different branches of the human species. And according to the
philosophy of this school, the abridgment of social distance is
undertaken only at the penalty of provoking inherent racial antipathy;
the price of social peace being the maintenance of mutually exclusive
worlds of racial habitation characterized by reciprocal racial
tolerance. The fatalism which runs through this viewpoint hinges upon a
belief in well established race differences upon which race prejudice is
believed to be based, and, the corresponding conviction that the only
way to lessen the belliose manifestations of race prejudice is by
rendering wholesale contact between members of each race impossible.</p>
<p>Assuming as the above argument does that American Negroes and whites
are distinguishable by marked dissimilarities in physiognomy, mentality
and social traditions, and that whatever hostilityexists between the
races arises from an aversion to these differences, the only means by
which antipathy can be eradicated is the very association and intimacy
which the apologists shun. Social experience substantiates this.</p>
<p>“There must be something,” said Livingstone<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>,
“in the appearance of white men frightfully repulsive to the
unsophisticated natives of Africa, for on entering villages previously
unvisited by Europeans, if we met a child coming quietly and
unsuspectingly toward us the moment he raised his eyes and saw the men
in ‘bags’ he would take to his heels in an agony of terror, such as we
might feel if we met a live Egyptian mummy at the door of the British
Museum. Alarmed by the child’s wild outcries, the mother rushes out of
the hut but darts back again at first glimpse of the fearful apparition.
Dogs turn tails and scurry off in dismay, and hens, abandoning their
chickens, fly screaming to the top of the houses.’’ Here we have the
elements of race prejudice. On the negative side, the stigmata of race
prejudice are the feelings of wonder at the strange, fear of that which
is unknown, and repulsion aroused in one individual by another who
differs in physical features or cultural traits; and, <span
class="pagenum">469</span> on the positive side, they are contempt for
and hate and hostility toward others who differ in these respects. But
if race prejudice is not accompanied with competitive activities or the
subjugation of one group by the other it is soon removed through
association. And the accommodation of groups and individuals to others
of different physiognomy and aesthetic standards takes place with
relative ease. According to Livingstone,<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
after one has associated with the blacks for a long period, “one feels
ashamed of the white skin. It seems unnatural like blanched celery or
white mice.” <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> And Stanley’s report of his feelings
on first meeting white men after crossing Africa coincides with
Livingstone’s. <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> He said: “As I looked into their
faces, I blushed that I was wondering at their paleness. …. The pale
color after so long gazing on rich black and richer bronze, had
something of an unaccountable ghastliness. I could not divest myself of
the feeling that they must be sick.’’ <a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Does the foregoing analysis cast much light on the causes of race
antipathy in the United States? Not very much, if any. In the first
place the association between whites and blacks has been and is today
more intimate than either the race-conscious white or black citizenry is
willing to admit. Not only have white boys and girls kissed their black
mammies but have been suckled by them. It is not infrequent that leading
persons in the white race, desiring to impress audiences with their
devotion to the Negro race, cite as evidence of fidelity their
recognition of some unpaid debt to an “old darkey’’ friend or to a black
mammy who was their wet nurse. Moreover the existence of a large mulatto
population is evidence of a very intimate physical contact which could
not have taken place had dominant whites, the aggressors, been repelled
by the Negro’s physical appearance; and conversely, whatever race
prejudice arose from the introduction of Negroes in America was soon
lost through sex relations and other close association. In the second
place the present antipathy cannot be attributed to a difference in
social traditions and aesthetic standards, since the life of the Negro
in the United States bespeaks knowledge of only those cultural
traditions that are American. It is not infrequent that the economic and
social subjugation of one race or class by another has led the
subordinated group to adopt the culture of the dominant. This has
happened to the Negro in the United States. If the first African Negroes
who came to America brought with them concepts of social institutions or
a culture typically African they could not put them to practice in
America. Moreover, we have no evidence of any attempts made by Negroes
to establish African culture in the United States. Nor can the American
Negro be considered in any logical sense African. The assimilation of
the Negro to American culture has been so complete that one observer<a
href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> has remarked: “With most marvelous
certainty, when we consider the conditions, the Negro in the South could
be trusted to perpetuate our political ideas and institutions if our
republic fell, as surely as the Gaul did his adopted institutions.”<a
href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> This cultural accommodation and
above all the physical contact which preceded and paralleled it, could
have but one effect upon the Negro,—the annihilation of a Negro national
physiognomy—and, in consequence, the Negro’s repudiation of African
<span class="pagenum">470</span> aesthetic standards. The ready market
which sellers of bleaching and hair straightening compounds find among
Negroes indicates the extent of this repudiation. But a surging race
consciousness among Negroes which has expressed itself in art and other
forms may seem to belie the repudiation of African aesthetic standards,
or it may be mistaken as the Negro’s attempt to establish a Negro
culture within the United States. Considerable controversy has centered
about the question of Negro culture as a product distinct from United
States culture.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> But close examination of the social
facts underlying the Negro’s position in the United States shows his
race consciousness to be merely a device which he has contrived to
compensate his thwarted ambition for full participation in American
institutions. Thus, neither cultural differences nor the horror of the
Negro’s external aspect account for present race antipathy in the United
States. Racial antipathy in the United States cannot, therefore, be
attributed to race prejudice. Some other explanation must be sought.</p>
<p>Slavery was an economic system which involved white freemen as
masters and black men as slaves. The Negro was not enslaved because his
complexion, and nose and lip formation differed from the white man’s.<a
href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> It would be just as reasonable to
assign the servitude of white serfs to the color of their skin which
conformed in paleness to that of the dominant whites. As a matter of
fact both the lower white and black classes were weak. Their impotence
coupled with the need for cheap labor meant their subjugation. For a
short period white and black bondsmen were on the same indefinite legal
footing. And it did not at first seem that the institution of serfdom
and, later, slavery could thrive in colonial United States. Several of
the colonies actually opposed the purchase of Negroes and the dumping of
expatriated Europeans and prisoners upon American soil. Serfdom was mild
as compared with slavery into which it developed. In 1661, there seemed
to have been the absence of any law or custom which established the
institution of slavery. The court records of Virginia, for example,
refers to Negroes as servants and not as slaves.<a href="#fn11"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>
Like the white servants the Negro became free at the expiration of their
indentures. Many freed Negroes of the colonial period acquired property
in slaves and land. But conditions did not long remain rosy. The chains
of chattel slavery which were to bind the Negro were already being
forged in the South at the anvil of economic necessity. Meanwhile
industrial conditions in the New England and Middle States were slowly
working the transformation of white serfs into wage-earners.</p>
<p>The supply of Negro labor was more plentiful than white labor. It was
also more easily secured, and consequently, <span
class="pagenum">471</span> cheaper than the latter. Negro labor being
cheaper than cheap white labor was more desired. Emmanuel Downing wrote
his brother-in-law, John Winthrop: “You know verie well how we shall
mayntayne 20 Moores cheaper than one English servant.” <a href="#fn12"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>
During the same period Negroes in the South not bound for a term were
coming to be appraised as high as thirty pounds while the most valuable
white redemptioners were worth not above fifteen pounds. <a href="#fn13"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>
Because of the increasing significance of Negro labor to the germinating
agricultural system in the South and the diminishing importance of it to
budding domestic capitalism in the North, the thrifty New Englanders
found it profitable to capture Indians, exchange them for Negroes, and
sell the Negroes to the southern planters. <a href="#fn14"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn15"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>
These were the faint murmurs of the regime which the rise of the
southern tobacco, cotton, rice and sugar plantations would crystallize
through successive legal enactments. The invention of the cotton gin by
Eli Whitney in 1793 gave impetus to cotton culture. A great cotton
kingdom arose extending from the uplands and covering the alluvial
plains of the southwest. Before the cotton gin was invented the sale of
a Negro rarely brought more than $300 but afterwards the price was twice
as high. The average value of a Negro was $800 in 1830, $1,200 in 1850
and from $1,400 to $2,000 in 1860.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> The invention of the
cotton gin made slavery more profitable now than ever; and the
anti-slavery agitation which was sprouting in the South was stifled. On
the other hand, New England’s barrenness made extensive agriculture and
slavery futile undertakings. However, its indented coast line enabled it
to build a commercial and shipping enterprise which supplied the South
with Negro labor; and its favorable position for manufacture developed a
domestic capitalism which wrought the metamorphosis of disadvantaged
white men from serfs to wage earners. These conditions determined the
rise of bourgeois democracy based upon economic competition and
individualism in the North and of landed aristocracy based upon slavery
and custom in the South.</p>
<p>Slavery was a profitable institution to the landed class who desired
to perpetuate it and to extend its geographical limits and the political
power based upon it. Like every economic system based upon the
exploitation of human labor, the slave regime sought rationalization for
its exploitation of Negroes. Slavery was therefore designated by the
whites to be God’s way of educating ignorant blacks and bringing them
into the marvelous light of His gospel. The literature which grew in
this period reveals much talk on the Negro’s natural unfitness for
civilization, his inhumanity and his uneducability. Charles Carroll
wrote a book and established from biblical texts that man was created in
the image of God, and, since, as everyone knows God not to be a Negro,
it follows that the Negro is not a man. John C. Calhoun, at a time when
Negro slaves were everywhere by intention deprived of the elements of
education, ventured that if he could find a Negro capable of giving the
syntax of a Greek verb he would be disposed to call him human. Thomas
Jefferson observed that a Negro could scarcely be found who was capable
of tracing and comprehending the investigation of Euclid.<a href="#fn17"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>
These and <span class="pagenum">472</span> similar dogmas on the Negro’s
predisposition to crime and his lack of sexual restraint furnished by
clergy and learned doctors established the psychological breastworks of
the slave empire.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the attitude of the landed aristocracy to the
white peasant and artisan was hardly better than that exhibited toward
the Negro. Negro slaves were usually much better off materially than the
submerged whites. This contrast in material lot undoubtedly inflamed the
lower white stratum against the Negro and rendered the Negro
contemptuous of it. Yet an ill founded fear of seditious combination
between outnumbering Negro slaves and landless whites led the dominant
whites to foster and augment race distinctions just as many modern
employers maintain a definite proportion of representatives of different
races and nationalities as a bulwark against labor organization and as
others, more ruthless, exploit race antipathy upon the theory of
<em>divide et imp</em> era. That this fear was something of a plaguing
nightmare Thomas Jefferson testified by his references to the landless
whites in the South, the growing mass of propertyless wage-earners in
the towns, and Negro slavery which he said made him tremble with anxiety
when he contemplated the future of his country. Foremost among the
distinctions initiated by the dominant whites was the statute against
marriages between white and black. Massachusetts prohibited white and
black marital unions as early as 1680.<a href="#fn18"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>
The prohibition against intermarriage soon became the rule in all of the
colonies although no laws were ever enacted against the cohabitation of
white masters with black female slaves. The running away of white
servants in company with Negroes must have occurred frequently, else
Virginia in 1661 would never have enacted a statute penalizing white
servants guilty of this offense.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> Suggestion and
imitation did their share in further promoting hostility between the
lower classes. To the master class the landless white was “po’ white
trash” and the Negro slave “nigger.” Each of the disadvantaged classes
seized the counter-appellation invented by the aristocrat out of its
contempt for it and arrogantly hurled it back at the other. Under this
growing race sentiment revolutionary coalition between the Negro slaves
and whites serfs need never have been feared; and if not actually feared
it was only because submerged blacks and whites in their weakness and
arrogance toward each other could be pitted one against the other.
Mutual animosity between poor whites and black slaves was strengthened
by the competition offered by free Negro artisans in the northern and
southern cities and by slave apprentices who upon being let to
contractors were used to beat down wages.<a href="#fn20"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>
The degree to which slavery was opposed by white workingmen, especially
immigrants, is revealed in the opposition of eighty German newspapers to
the opening up of new federal territory to possible slave settlement by
the Kansas-Nebraska Act.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> But the opposition to
slavery which emanated from the Northwest and the eastern wage-earners
was caused by their recognition of a fundamental antagonism of interest
between the slavery system and free labor rather than by their
humanitarism. As a matter of fact the northern wage-earners were as
hostile to Negro freemen as to the slaves. The mobbing [473].{pagenum}
of Negroes was quite a common occurrence in the northern and middle
western cities during the pre-civil war period.<a href="#fn22"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Upon the slave regime the social relationship of the white man and
Negro in the United States was founded. It was the relationship of
master and servant. The traditions which were its psychological props
did not wholly disappear after the dissolution of the slave regime.<a
href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> The white man’s divine right to
rule and exploit, and the Negro’s divine heritage to hue wood and draw
water for the master in the big house are sacrosanct traditions which
the regime bequeathed to our not incredulous generation. Yet it should
be obvious that the caste psychology which was built around white
masters as the “exalted of God” differed very little from that of the
ancient theocracy in which Jews were “Jahweh’s elect;” or from that of
feudalism wherein serfs were bitches and trollopes and, humble
handicraftsmen, the lineal ancestors of modern capitalists, might have
their ears boxed by offended patricians; or from that of the
contemporary plutocracy which has raised up a host of panegyrists to
extol the virtues of those who rule by divine right of superior
chromosomes. Nor should it not be equally discernible to our generation
that a past economic circumstance fashioned a psychology which sets in
contemporary society the limits of racial association and determines its
mental norms. One observer in noting this psychology points out: ”The
especially caste nature of the division—as distinguished from those
personal differences which democratic tradition recognizes— is seen in
the feeling, universal among the whites, that the Negro must be held
apart and subordinate not merely as an individual, or any number of
individuals, but as a race, a social whole. That is, the fact that many
individuals of this race are equal, and some superior, to the majority
of whites does not, in the opinion of the latter, make it just or
expedient to treat them apart from the mass of their race. To dine with
a Negro, to work or play by his side, or to associate in any relation
where superiority cannot be asserted is held to be degrading and of evil
example, no matter what kind of Negro he may be. It is the practice and
policy of the dominant rac.e to impress upon the Negro that he belongs
by birth to a distinct order out of which he can in no way depart. There
or nowhere must he find his destiny. If he wishes to mingle with whites
it must be as an acknowledged inferior.”<a href="#fn24"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>
Thus agitation against segregation and jim crowism come to be
interpreted by the dominant whites as advocacy of intermarriage or
“social equality” as it is more euphemistically called in the South.
Social equality is not taboo because of any abhorrence to blackness, as
we have already noticed, but because social approval of mixed marriages
would mean guaranteeing to members of each race equal protection and
rights in their sex relations. To do this would be to recognize Negroes
as equals. But society <span class="pagenum">474</span> demands that the
Negro’s social and economic infirmity be maintained. Rather than permit
equality between the races, it is thought best to leave the males of the
dominant race unfettered by law and custom in their relations with women
of the lower race and to lynch Negroes who look with lust in their eyes
upon white women. When such suggestion as “Negroes prefer being to
themselves’’ is ineffective in keeping obstreperous Negroes in “their
place’’ the more drastic methods of segregation and jim crowism are
invoked. Even though an inviolate and sacred institution, segregation
may be temporarily suspended in the case of the Negro servant who
accompanies his master or his master’s children on public carriers.</p>
<p>In none of the foregoing phenomena does color serve as the basis of
racial antipathy as much as it does the means by which a socially
submerged class is distinguished from a dominant. The antipathy between
white and black bears all of the earmarks of class prejudice which has
been rationalized in justification of the exploitation and subjugation
of the Negro. As a result of this a whole crop of ideas have been shaped
into a Negro stereotype to which the public reacts. For example, the
author has been very often told that Negroes make excellent domestics
and personal servants because of their affection and slowness to insult
but that their mentality is such that one could never trust them with
technical processes in industry. Again in matters of health, the Negro
is viewed with pitying fatalism. The Negro’s high mortality is
attributed to the fact that he is a Negro. In other words, the fact that
Negro mortality is higher than that of the white is believed to be the
resultant of a difference in organic structure which lessens the Negro’s
chances for survival in rigorous climates. To race and not to environic
factors such as inadequate and poor housing, and insufficient income is
the high mortality of the Negro attributed.</p>
<p>The extent to which these opinions are prevalent is ascertainable.
The author prepared a questionnaire on race relations and submitted it
to 144 prominent white persons selected at random. Two questions in the
schedule read: “What distinguishing traits of mentality or character do
you believe Negroes to possess?” and “On what facts, authorities or
sources of information do you base your opinions?” The table that
follows is a summary of 37 replies. Column 1 in the table gives “the
kind of contact or observations” subjects had. Column 2 gives “the
distinguishing traits” which Negroes are believed to possess.</p>

<p>Underlying the whole maze of assumptions on Negro mental and
character differences is the opinion actually stated in one of the
replies: “<em>The Negro and white man are physiologically, mentally and
morally different.</em>” It is but one step from this dogma to another
belief which was stated by a social service worker: “<em>The average
Negro’s capacity for loyalty exceeds the white man’s but the average
white man excels the average Negro in drive, persistence and
punctuality,</em>” Now capacity implies potentiality which is a factor
in heredity. To say that one individual or that one race has greater
capacity than another for loyalty as against persistence or punctuality
is to say that these traits are hereditary in that individual or race.
It is not to be doubted, however, that the social environment in which
the Negro has lived and that in which the white man has lived has made
for the development of loyalty in the former and for the development of
punctuality and drive in the latter. Contrast the traits of temperament
fostered by a world of competitive business enterprise with those that
are not only encouraged, but actually enforced by a social status which
demands submissiveness and which until recently existed apart from
modern industry and its cultural accompaniments. If there is racial
capacity for punctuality, loyalty and persistence these traits inhere in
the chromosomes, are transmissible and, are, therefore, not due to
nurture. If, on the other hand, they do not inhere in germplasm they are
not transmissible and one race does not have any greater capacity than
another for the expression of such traits. The known traits that are
hereditary include neither punctuality nor loyalty nor persistence.<a

As a class the Negro is of lower mental rank than white. Morality is
less well founded than that of white.<br />

<li>
It has not been proved that there are qualitative differences;
apparently good evidence that in general intellectual ability Negroes as
a whole are somewhat inferior to American white people. Of course, there
is much over-lapping in the range of mentality, many Negroes excelling
whites in intelligence.<br />

All traits that are and would be possessed by individuals placed in
similar environment. They do not vary innately from any other race as
far as my knowledge goes. Psychological testing has never established
its ability to test innate capacity.

<p><span class="pagenum">477</span> From contact with Negro servants and
with a limited number of Negro school children <em>instability of
character, superstitious-ness, laziness, irresponsibility, moral laxity,
mental inferiority, unreliability, naiveté, emotionalism, and incapacity
for sustained mental effort are deduced as negroid traits by 9 out of a
total of 18 persons</em>. Not only is this association which was
restricted to servants inadequate as a logical basis for judging the
mentality of Negroes as a race, but the conclusions based upon this
limited contact are contradicted by the experience of 7 other persons
who had employed Negroes; by that of 1 who knew Negroes intimately; and
by that of another who taught Negroes in college and had associated with
intellectual Negroes. None of the latter 9 persons had discovered mental
differences or could distinguish between Negroes and other people of
little training and opportunity.</p>
<p>The second main classification “Scientific Experimentation and Study”
comprises 9 persons, mainly college teachers, whose opinions were based
almost wholly upon scientific studies, having themselves either
administered mental tests to Negroes or studied the literature on racial
and individual differences of mentality, and, the general
anthropological and statistical theory involved in the subject. This
classification may be roughly sub-divided under the three following
headings:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Those who from scientific study found no distinguishable traits of
mentality among Negroes:</li>
<li>Those who found distinguishable<span class="pagenum">478</span>
mental traits and believed them to be racial and inherent; and</li>
<li>Those who found mental differences but attributed them to social
environment rather than to heredity and race.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the first class there was only one person; in the second there
were five; and in the third there were 3 persons—a wide variety of
opinion among college professors and teachers all of whose opinions were
based upon almost identical scientific data.</p>
<p>The opinions outlined above pass as legal tender on “Race.” They have
gained wide currency, first, by the fabrication of fictions on Negro
character and mentality; second, by the crystallization of these
fictions into dogmas of racial, biological and psychological superiority
and inferiority in justification of the status quo; third, by the
constant exploitation of these dogmas by certain investigators whenever
race difference has furnished easy explanation of phenomena, which,
while readily lending themselves to an interpretation on the basis of
race, have been shown by later less subjective inquiry to be caused by
factors more social than racial; and above all, by the popularization of
these things through press, pulpit, school and other media of popular
education until racial fictions gain general acceptance and become
intrenched social habit which by verbalization is translated into a
public opinion on the Negro. This public opinion is not wholly the
contemporary mind’s creation; it is a part of American heritage on race.
It persists although the more flagrant aspects of its economic
determinants have been obliterated. Its universality is felt in the
arrangements of almost every social institution. Even in the labor
movement color-caste feeling has determined the degree and manner of
Negro affiliation. And the logic which teaches that the ultimate
interests of socially disadvantaged whites and blacks are more
coincidental than that of white capitalists and white wage-earners or of
black capitalists and black wage-earners has not convinced either
American white workers or Negroes of its soundness as the American
Federation of Labor’s policy relative to the organization of Negro
workers exemplifies. Aside from the operation of peculiar economic
forces within the Federation to which should be ascribed its oscillating
attitude toward the organization of Negroes, is the fact that the
proletariat just as the bourgeoisie cuts its social cloth according to
tradition-pattern.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Another sidelight on the universality of the popular Negro stereotype
is the opinions of the psychologists reflected in main classification II
in the foregoing table. The psychologists are probably not entirely
immune to its unconscious influence, despite their maturing habit of
academic objectivity. An analysis of the mental tests and the judgment
of Negro mentality based upon them, seems to reveal a prescience for
discovering Negro inferiority. Nevertheless, Negro inferiority is Negro
inferiority no matter by whom invented. For all of the labyrinthal
technology western civilization has put at our disposal, we have done
little more than confirm the pronouncements of Jefferson, Carroll,
Calhoun and the rest of the sages of democracy who consigned the Negro
to a menial station in American life.</p>
