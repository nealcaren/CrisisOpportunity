<p><span class="pagenum">240</span> Is the Negro race to preserve its
physical identity or to be bleached white within any calculable time
with which we need now concern ourselves? A satisfying answer to this
query would not only go a long way towards relieving the American mind
of a perplexing anxiety, but would also greatly facilitate practical and
acceptable plans of race adjustment. The American white man has been so
earnestly engaged in volunteer assistance to Providence to keep the
races apart that he has failed to notice the plain indications of the
outcome under the normal operation of biological and social law. A new
Negroid type is gradually emerging which clearly foreshadows the
immediate, if not the ultimate, physical destiny of the Negro race on
this continent.</p>
<p>The world is now giving concern to the outcome of the contact,
attrition and adjustment of the various races and nations of mankind in
a more serious sense than it has ever done before. Easy transportation
of material substance and the free communicability of ideas have brought
the ends of the earth together in one human community. No longer do
mountains, rivers and seas form fixed boundaries for human habitation.
But according to the universal experience of mankind, race contact means
race admixture. The primal passion of sex runs deeper than racial or
cultural cleavage. Race antipathy, religious inhibition, social
proscription and cultural pretensions, all break down in face of the
cosmic urge to multiply and replenish the earth. The laws of biology
care little for the decrees of the propagandist or the sanction of
priests. Historically, the admixture of races has taken place despite
the prevailing social polity, and mainly outside of the marriage vow.
When two races of wide-apart levels are brought together, there is a
mixed offspring without certified paternity. The stigma of illegitimacy
is visited upon the children of natural passion unto the third and
fourth generation, until the <span class="pagenum">241</span> process of
fusion has been completed without trace. The process of race fusion is
of no sociological importance beyond the time when the brand of bastardy
begets an unfavorable social opinion. What boots it how the Anglo-Saxon
came to be; whether the original fusion of blood was with or without the
sanction of civil or ceremonial law? The important fact remains, that he
is what he is. The census of 1890 recorded nearly seventy thousand
octoroons in the United States. Practically all of these can cross, and
many of them have crossed, the great race divide, carrying with them
their quotum of Negro blood. That these octoroons were begotten through
the process of bastardy, makes absolutely no difference in the final
effect upon the blood composition of the American people. Our statesmen
in their frantic efforts to keep the races apart by statutes and civil
regulations should bear in mind that comprehensively, in the long run,
miscegination without the law will be just as effectual as miscegination
under sanction of law.</p>
<p>The composite progeny is always the offspring of the males of the
stronger and the females of the weaker race. The sons of God never fail
to look lustfully upon the daughters of men. By the instinct of male
jealousy, the males of the lower or lesser breed are forbidden personal
or social intimacy with the females of the higher race and class. The
same law of sexual jealousy would impel the males of the inferior order
to give like shelter and protection to their own womenfolk, but they
lack the power to give their purpose force and effectiveness.</p>
<p>The dominant white sentiment in America abominates race admixture so
far as the European and the African are concerned. Indeed, this is the
general attitude of the white towards the non-white portions of the
human race, which is most assertive in the Northern European or Nordic
type. This feeling has been greatly accentuated in America since the end
pf the World War. Rabid propaganda has been stimulated and fostered. The
resources of science have been ransacked for proof of the evil effect of
race fusion. The discarded argument based upon an exploded theory of
divine purpose has been resurrected and made to do service for the new
propaganda. Men are ever prone to interpret facts to sustain their
notions and to fashion their opinions to suit their prejudices. While
science has given <span class="pagenum">242</span> no final word as to
the effect of race intermixture upon the physical, intellectual and
moral stamina of the offspring, yet the rabid advocates of race purity
are asserting the baneful effects of such crossing, with the assumed
authority of scientific certitude. The physical separateness of the
races is the one passionate dogma which dominates the American mind
today. Its sanction is stronger than that of science, law or religion.
Race consciousness is growing keener and keener with the passing years.
Physical distinction counts for more than cult or creed. The test of an
ennobling brotherhood is determined by birth of the flesh rather than
birth of the spirit. The white Christian must, by the essential
requirement of his creed, assent to the doctrine of the equality of the
soul, but he stubbornly balks at the suggestion of social equality. All
sorts of devices are used to keep the races physically separate and
socially asunder. Twenty-six states have passed anti-miscegination laws.
Separate schools and jim-crow regulations are made in the southern
states where the Negro resides in greatest relative proportion. Custom
and tradition forbid social intermingling by a sanction stronger than
law. The Mongolian is placed under the same ban as the Negro. Facts can
always be found and arguments fashioned to support dominant opinion. If
the undesirable element be black, like the Negro, it must be excluded on
the ground of inferiority which threatens general debasement. If it be
yellow, like the Japanese, it meets with like treatment on the grounds
of suspected equality, or even superiority. So feeble is the force of
logic against the avowed dominant purpose. The continuance of this
intolerant spirit on the part of the white race in America is as certain
as any other social tendency concerning which we now have predictive
data. It is with this attitude that we have to deal and against which,
as a background, we must project all projects and plans for better race
relations. The white man is primarily responsible for whatever race
crossing has already taken place, or that threatens to take place in the
future. Emerson somewhere says that no man can come near me except by my
own act. The Negro woman has been victimized. The approximation of the
races is the result. Should the white race issue a decree enforceable
upon every <span class="pagenum">243</span> member of that blood, that
there shall be no further intermingling of the races, the process would
instantly cease. But instead, the burden of blame is sought to be placed
upon the victimized race which bears the brunt of it all. One is again
reminded of Aesop’s wolf, accusing the lamb of muddying the stream from
the lower level. There would be no need of drastic legislation,
passionate assertion of determination, rabid propaganda and aroused
rancor of race, if the white man’s race pride could control his sex
passion. But this is perhaps placing too great an inhibition upon human
nature. Penelope, the wife of Ulysses, in the Odyssey kept her suitors
in indefinite suspense by promising to render a final decision when she
had completed knitting a fancy fabric. But the fidelity of her heart and
the cunning of her mind led her to unravel at night the newly knitted
section of the preceding day. So the answer was delayed until the return
of her faithful spouse. The white man defeats by his lustful indulgences
by night all of his finely spun theories of race purity elaborated by
day.</p>
<p>The fact that sex urge is a deeper and more profound instinct than
race preference, or race pride, should lead to serious reflection as to
the permanence of race consciousness as the dominant influence in human
relationships. Nor is this the only passion that often rises above the
distinctions of race. Political and patriotic fervor and religious zeal
have often evinced a force and stubbornness that swept away all barriers
of flesh and blood. The rise of Islam and its threatened renaissance
show the possibility of the dominance of the spirit over the flesh. The
basic principle of Christianity requires detachment of devotion and a
strength of discipleship which transcend all racial animosities and
antagonisms. The religion of the Nazarene, in its pure essence,
recognizes neither Jew nor Greek, Barbarian nor Scythian, bondmen nor
freemen. Christianity is absolutely incompatible with caste or color.
The attempt to reconcile the gospel of Jesus with the arrogant
intolerance of the Nordic is a serious reflection upon the spiritual
capacity of the Teutonic race, whose genius for concrete practical
accomplishments is to be extolled beyond all praise. Spiritual kinship
transcends all human and social relations among mankind.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">244</span> In regarding the spirit of race
intolerance as a fixed stubborn fact which conditions our present day
policies, let it always be understood that we are dealing only with the
present and the glimpse of future time now vouchsafed to us. Human
shortsightedness cannot envisage the far reaching future. Our wisest
foresight, like the head light of an engine, can see only a few furlongs
in advance. The power of human prophecy is feeble; nor does it increase
with general progress and advancement. No human being knows what a day
may bring forth any more than he did in the days of Noah’s Flood. Had
any soothsayer predicted the present state of the world twelve years
ago, he would have been ranked with the amiable fanatics who ever and
anon amuse us with prophecies of the end of time. We are equally
impotent to foretell the political, economic or social condition of the
world a short ten years hence. The sudden emergence of deep seated moral
and spiritual emotional propaganda may sweep away the sensibilities of
race, and usher in a new order of things based upon more primal human
passion.</p>
<p>All profound religious teachers and deep social thinkers base their
hopes upon the social, moral and spiritual unity of mankind, as “the one
far off divine event, to which the whole creation moves.” According to
any comprehensive and satisfying philosophy, the brotherhood of man is
more fundamental than the fellowship of race. The ultimate physical and
social identity of all peoples occupying a common territory is a logical
necessity of thought. The straight-thinking mind, free from
predilections and social bias, refuses to give assent to any other
conclusion. This consummation, however, is too far removed from the
sphere of present day sensibilities to have much appreciable effect upon
practical procedure in this prosaic, work-a-day world in which we live.
We are mainly motivated by apparent, persistent, stubborn realities
which we can neither defeat nor frustrate. In our helplessness we are
forced to deal with conditions as they are, rather than as we vaguely or
vainly imagine they ought to be, or as we may cherish the hope they will
be in the ages yet to come. To be regarded as a timeserver is often
considered as a designation of reproach; but finite comprehension can
only serve its day and generation. It <span class="pagenum">245</span>
requires omniscience to serve eternity. The deepest race distinctions in
the world prevail in Christendom, which recognizes neither race nor
color. But a pragmatic policy must deal with existing realities rather
than with idealized abstractions. We must discuss the physical destiny
of the Negro race in America, under the Christian dispensation as it
prevails now on the earth, rather than according to some idealistic
interpretation that has never yet been practicalized on land or sea.</p>
<p>In the United States the original red race is rapidly being
extinguished by the encroachment of a too strenuous civilization. The
yellow race is excluded by drastic immigration restrictions calculated
to keep America white, or as nearly white as may be, with the
troublesome non-white elements now on hand. The white and black races
will be the residuary constituents of the population of the continental
United States. America has been called the great international melting
pot in which the various nationalities of Europe are to be fused into
one homogeneous type. This process, however, is supposed to include only
the different branches of the Aryan race. The white race alone is deemed
a worthy component of the desired compound. The non-white races of
Africa, Asia, and the scattered isles of the sea, are not considered as
contributary factors of the forthcoming American race. But the rejected
elements are also being fused into ethnic solidarity, which is basically
Negroid. There will be, not one American race, but two; the one white,
and the other neither white nor black, but a brownish-yellow or a
yellowish-brown.</p>
<p>The term Negro is used to designate a group of peoples whose maternal
ancestors came from Africa. It involves all of the complexities of blood
and varieties of color of the entire human family. There is no race
variety on the face of the globe that is not represented through some
trace of its blood in this new Negroid type, now in process of fusion.
While the term Negro denotes color, it also connotes condition and
status. The social segregation of the Negro race, together with all who
bear marks of physical semblance thereto, is made easy by reason of its
traditional servile relationship. The color line constitutes the deepest
and most easily distinguishable line of cleavage in our cosmopolitan
population. All elements of the <span class="pagenum">246</span> white
race are the more consciously and agreeably solidified by appeal to the
antithetic colored race. In Europe, where they have no such racial
antithesis, intra-racial divisions and strife are far more sharp and
acrimonious. The division of mankind into Jew and Gentile, Greek and
Barbarian, Christian and Heathen, white and colored, rests upon the
basis of contrasted cultures. Those who belong to the higher assumption
feel themselves drawn closer together by reason of the superior conceit
which lifts them above the level of the baser groups that fall without
the circle of their coveted ennoblement. The phrase “white and colored”
is relished as a talismanic expression which distinguishes the white man
from his less favored and more unfortunate fellow creatures.</p>
<p>The American Negro does not constitute a race in the sense of a
compact ethnic unity, imbued with a common consciousness and impelled by
a common impulse. There is no sufficiently unified physical basis as a
background for the emergence of a collective soul with the passion and
stubbornness to compel coordinated action and persistent procedure.
There is rather a promiscuous assortment of individuals with diverse
physical and spiritual dispositions, actuated by the antagonistic
instincts of the Ishmaelite. The imported slaves represented disjected
and expatriated individuals, captured from wide apart areas of the
African continent, and representing tribes that differed widely in cult
and color. The process of transplantation covered the period of two
centuries. The enslaved captives, if they had ever acquired, had
doubtless lost a patriotic devotion to country and native land. There
was no social sense of the wrongs and injustice involved in their
capture, enslavement and expatriation. For the most part they were
slaves or captives in their native land. To them, crossing the ocean was
merely shifting the scene of their misfortune from one continent to
another.</p>
<p>Psychologists tell us that group consciousness emerges most readily
and is most easily sustained on a basis of physical likeness. The wide
distribution of the African slaves in time and space, and the vastly
varying social circumstances of their native land, made of them an
aggregation of irrelated assortment of unfortunates, united only by the
bond of a servile status <span class="pagenum">247</span> and a somewhat
similar color. These unfortunate children of nature were divested of
every semblance of self expression and development, along the line of
their natural bent and genius. The alien master directed every move they
made and controlled the channels of intra-communication. Wherever two or
three of them were gathered together, a white man was placed in their
midst to confound their spontaneous council and to frustrate the
formulation of a common purpose. There never was more unpromising
material and untoward circumstances out of which to build up and develop
a race.</p>
<p>The white race began to mix its blood with that of the Negro with the
landing of the first ship load at Jamestown. From that day to this the
sun has never set and risen without the reenforcement of European blood
in African veins. In the beginning, this libidinous miscegenation was
wholly without social consciousness. It was only when a considerable
body of mulattoes appeared that the philosophers and statesmen of that
day began to animadvert upon the possible future jeopardy of a
half-caste issue. Even now, the effect that the absence of the mulatto
might have had on race relations is a matter of curious but interesting
speculation. We are told in Greek mythology that Father Chronos devoured
the offspring of his lust in order to avoid future complications of a
troublesome issue. The white race in America sought the same end by
relegating the mixed issue to the status of the mother’s race. This
policy served, for the time being, to keep the white race legally pure
while mixing the Negro race. But here again the inexorable laws of
biology proved to be stronger and more effective than the cunning legal
contrivance of man. The Latin races, on the other hand, incorporate the
composite progeny into the dominant race, which becomes frankly mixed,
ostensibly leaving the lower and weaker element pure. The immediate
effect of the pragmatic policy of the Teuton proves to be more agreeable
to his asserted pride of race; but in the cosmic scheme of ethical
requirement, the time must come for a reckoning for the awful sin of
imposing the consequences of the lustful burden of one race upon
another. Theodore Roosevelt, in one of his contributions from South
America, raised the query as to whether the Teutonic or the Latin policy
would lead sooner to final and <span class="pagenum">248</span>
satisfactory race adjustment. But like Pontius Pilot, in his query as to
the nature of truth, he did not vouchsafe an answer. The Negro woman is
made to bear the brunt of all of the races, nations, and varieties of
mankind now living or sojourning in this country.</p>
<p>In the veins of the so-called Negro race, there courses some strain
of the blood of every known subdivision of the human family. Not only
within the limits of the same race itself, but within the veins of the
same individual, strains of blood are mixed and mingled in inextricable
confusion. Indeed, if there be such a thing as natural race antipathy,
the Negro race would be rent asunder by internal and external
animosities.</p>
<p>The physical destiny of the Negro race is not immediate amalgamation
with the white race, but the blending of these diverse bloods into
something like physical homogeneity, and the formulation of a group
consciousness upon a substantial basis of physical solidarity. If this
was not a normal tendency, enlightened race statesmanship would make it
a conscious policy. The integrity of an outcast and self-despised race
never has been, and never can be, preserved. The Negro in America will
either be bleached by bastardy or destroyed through debauchery unless it
develops a leadership and an amor propre, proudly conscious of its place
and mission in the general scheme of human advancement. The Jewish race
has preserved its physical purity through four thousand years, though
densely crowded and environed by an unfriendly gentile world. And yet
the unsanctioned overflow of Hebrew blood has enriched the veins of
every race and nation among whom the chosen people have dwelt since the
days of Abraham. The integrity of the breed, however, has been
maintained by religious sanction rather than by any biological
promptings or physical racial instinct.</p>
<p>The quickest and perhaps the easiest solution of the race problem in
America would be the immediate physical absorption of the Negro element
into the white race. Were the quantum of black blood evenly diffused
throughout, the resulting blend would average eleven-twelfths white.
This would meet the legal definition of a white person in several
southern states and would represent as slight a strain of Negro blood as
<span class="pagenum">249</span> can be traced with any scientific or
practical certainty. There is no proved precedent or convincing argument
that the physical, intellectual, or moral result would be deteriorative.
This result, however, is not probable and hardly possible, in face of
the fixed and determined attitude of the white race which controls the
situation. Nor would it be the most helpful solution, so far as the
world problem of race contact and adjustment is concerned. To absorb a
handful of Negroes in America and leave the unbleached millions of
Africa in their savage blackness, would be to deepen the gulf of racial
cleavage as a world problem. It would be worse than useless from a
sociological point of view for the whites of the Pacific Coast to absorb
the few hundred thousand Mongolians now sojourning in their midst, and
leave the half billion yellow Asiatics confronting them from the other
side of the sea. If there is any divine purpose in working out the
universal plan of racial amity and good will throughout the world, it
would not be promoted by the immediate amalgamation either of the Negro
or the Mongolian fragments now living in America.</p>
<p>The attitude of the Negro race towards amalgamation can have only a
negative effect. The more anxious he seems to bring about amalgamation,
the more certainly will he help to defeat its consummation. The weaker
race can destroy its separate identity only by a process of complaisant
prostitution, whose ethical implications are too repugnant to be
contemplated as a serious racial policy. The American Negro will be
forced by outside compulsion to maintain his social and physical
identity, independent of any purpose or policy on his part. The Negro
will thus become one with himself long before he becomes one with the
American people.</p>
<p>While we muse, the fire burns. A new sub-race variety is forming
under our very eyes. The future Negro race in America will be neither
black nor white, but a yellowish-brown with albicant tendency. The
federal census shows unmistakably the direction in which the wind is
blowing. The mulatto element has steadily increased over the black from
the earlier decades to the present time. Strictly speaking, the term
Mulatto includes only the first offspring of Negro and European
parentage; but according to census definition it includes all Negroes
<span class="pagenum">250</span> with a perceptible trace of white
blood. Due allowances must be made for discrepant definitions of the
several censuses and also of the ability or inclination of the
enumerators to differentiate finely as to shades of color and degrees of
blood composition. The Negro himself can furnish no trustworthy data.
Frederick Douglass used to say that genealogical trees did not flourish
among slaves. The census of 1890 defined as “black” all persons having
three-fourths or more of black blood. This is perhaps as close a margin
as the average enumerator would be able to estimate. After passing the
three-fourths limit, in case of the black quadroon as of the white
quadroon, the individual would normally be classed with the race from
which he derived the preponderance of his blood. The Fourteenth Census
shows that there were 1,660,534 mulattoes in the United States in 1920,
as against 2,050,686 in 1910. This discrepancy may be accounted for by
the probability that part of the number returned as mulattoes in 1910
were classed as white in 1920, and partly by the larger probability that
many more of them had been swallowed up by the mass-life of the race and
returned as black.</p>
<p>The rapid growth of the mulatto element is not due in any great
degree to its inherent fecundity. The mulatto birth rate is probably
lower and the death rate higher than that of the blacks, under similar
conditions of living. Every fresh infusion of white blood increases the
proportional strength of the mulatto element. The Negro offspring of
white parentage may be regarded as a continuing, though a gradually
diminishing, factor in the equation of the colored population. There is
not likely to be much further fresh infusion of white blood into the
Negro race. Under the institution of slavery, the Negro woman was
suppressed below the level of self-respect. She often felt her enhanced
importance by becoming the mother of a mulatto child. The white master
or overseer felt no legal, social or conscientious restraint in
victimizing the female chattel. Had this institution continued another
two hundred years without fresh importation of blacks from the continent
of Africa, the race would have become well bleached through this
libidinous process. But the growing sense of self-respect on the part of
the Negro, as well as the increasing restraints of law and con<span
class="pagenum">251</span>science on the part of the white man, have
checked, if not halted, this bastardizing process. The establishment of
domestic ties and family pride in colored society effectively forbids
such illicit relations, and makes social outcasts of the illegitimate
issue. The laws of twenty-six states forbid the intermarriage of the
races, which absolutely estops legitimate mulatto offspring. The states
in which the bulk of the Negroes reside are found within this number.
The social sensibilities of the races have grown so delicate, even in
the North, that intermarriage has become exceedingly rare, even where
there were no forbidding laws. The residential segregation of the Negro
will lessen the opportunity of intimate contact of the races and
therefore of illicit offspring. Illicit relations will decrease in
proportion to the extension of separate areas of racial domicile. The
rise of the “sage femme” and the widely advertised practice of race
suicide, also serve to limit the fresh production of mulattoes. There
are few mulatto babies born in Harlem, or in Philadelphia, Chicago or
Detroit.</p>
<p>Of the 1,660,000 colored persons returned as mulattoes in the census
of 1920, and of more than as many more with concealed white blood in
their veins, the overwhelming majority, especially of the younger
generation, are offspring of colored fathers and mothers. There is
already a large quantity of white blood in Negro veins. This blood tends
to diffuse itself equally throughout the whole mass until it shall have
assumed an approximate oneness in color and physical likeness. The
process of diffusion will be greatly facilitated by the well known
tendency of the darker male to mate with the lighter female. A
homochrome marriage within the colored race is unusual.</p>
<p>The obvious proneness of the male for the lighter female is set forth
by Paul Laurence Dunbar in his allusion to “the swarthy maid with her
swarthier swain.”</p>
<p>Many thousand Negroes have crossed, are now crossing, and in the
future will cross, the great racial and social divide, and incorporate
themselves into the white race, in order to escape the nether status of
their mother blood. It is needless to denounce or condemn this
clandestine tendency. They are pursuing the normal human motive of self
interest and personal advantage. These racial transmigrants carry with
them as <span class="pagenum">252</span> much of the despised blood as
can easily be concealed under an albicant skin and unkinking hair. The
white race will take only such homeopathic dashes of Negro blood as to
remain substantially pure, at least in outward semblance. The
transposition of the quadroon and the octoroon will tend to widen the
physical margin between the races, and will also facilitate the more
rapid diffusion of the residuary white blood throughout the Negro
race.</p>
<p>A careful observation of Negro schools, churches, and other
assemblages, in all parts of the country, convinces the writer that
fully three-fourths of the rising generation have some noticeable
infusion of white blood. One finds about as many children of undiluted
Negro type as of the opposite extreme who cannot easily be detected from
white. Both extremes, however, are rapidly diminishing in quantity,
while the average of the race is approaching a medium of color and
physical characteristics. Within the next three or four generations it
will be hard to find a pure blooded Negro outside the remote black belts
of the rural South. The near whites will have crossed the line or bred
backward on the color scale. A new Negroid race will have arisen.</p>
<p>Thus a clear indication of the physical destiny of the Negro element
in America ought to enable us to deal more effectively with the
complicated and perplexing problem. The welding together of this
incoherent racial group into a compact physical and social unity, to
awaken a race consciousness and to inspire a concerted purpose of
cooperation with the larger white group in all the ways of civilization
and human advancement, ought to engage the highest energies of Negro
leadership and to enkindle its keenest enthusiasm for human service. On
the other hand, it ought to free the white man from the frantic dread of
amalgamation and race debasement which now harasses his waking hours and
haunts him in his dreams.</p>
