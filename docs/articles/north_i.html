<p><span class="pagenum">115</span> The present migration of Negroes
from the South is another chapter in the story of the masses struggling
to secure better conditions of living and larger life.</p>
<p>This movement northward is vitally changing the South, the North, and
the Negroes themselves, North and South. The facts should be studied
therefore sympathetically and frankly to arrive at “a complete
understanding and cooperation of all forces. North and South, white and
black, that are Ln the last analysis necessary to the right solution of
a nation-wide problem with its nation-wide responsibility.”</p>
<p>The geographical and numerical extent of this migration has been
large. The movement is due to fundamental economic and social forces. It
has already produced such far-reaching effects in the South that
remedies are now being sought and applied. The part of this question
which pertains more nearly to the South will be discussed here, and the
part which relates to the North in a later article.</p>
<p>This migration during the past two years is the second large exodus
since Lincoln’s memorable Emancipation Proclamation. A constant,
fluctuating stream, a part of the drift of the general population from
the rural districts to the cities, was moving northward from 1875 until
1915. This followed an exodus between 1865 and 1875 similar to the
present one.</p>
<p>The breaking up of the plantation system based upon slavery and
racial friction of Ku KIux and Reconstruction days were the moving
causes of the striking increase of that period. Between 1890 and 1900
there was also a considerable increase in the movement, probably due to
the economic and social disturbances of the decade.</p>
<p>The fact that there has been a constant movement northward is shown
by the percentage of increase, based upon the United States census
figures, of Negro population during each decade since 1860 for nine of
the northern and border cities, as follows: Boston, Greater New York,
Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Evansville
and St. Louis. Between 1860 and 1870 the Negro population increased
about 51 per cent (for eight cities); from 1870 to 1880 about 36.4 per
cent (for eight cities); from 1880 to 1890 about 36.2 per cent; from
1890 to 1900 about 74.4 per cent and from 1900 to 1910 about 37.4 per
cent.</p>
<p>During this time the rate of increase for the total Negro population
was as follows: 1860 to 1870, 9.9 per cent; 1870 to 1880, 34.9 par cent;
1880 to 1890, 13.5 per cent; 1890 to 1900, 18.0 per cent; 1900 to 1910,
11.2 per cent. A comparison of the increase of the Negro population in
these northern cities with the increase of the total Negro population
shows that the increase in the northern cities in four decades has been
from nearly three times as large to about five times as large as the
increase over the whole country.</p>
<p>The increase of the Negro population in southern cities which may be
compared with the increase in northern cities for the same decades is as
follows: From 1860 to 1870 about 90.7 per cent (for 14 cities); from
1870 to 1880 about 25.5 per cent (for 15 cities); from 1880 to 1890
about 38.9 per cent (for 15 cities); from 1890 to 1900 about 20.6 per
cent (for 16 cities); and from 1900 to 1910 about 20.6 per cent (for 16
cities). The southern cities included are Wilmington, Baltimore,
Washington, Norfolk, Richmond, Charleston, Augusta, Savannah,
Louisville, Chattanooga, Nashville, Memphis, Birmingham (1900-1910),
Mobile, New Orleans.</p>
<p>A comparison of the figures for northern and southern cities shows
clearly that the movement northward has been and is a part of a general
movement to cities. The migrants from rural districts, however, prefer
northern cities. This is evident from the fact that in three of the five
decades since 1860 the increase for northern cities exceeded that for
southern cities, being 24.6 per cent greater between 1870 and 1880,53.8
per cent greater between 1890 and 1900 and 16.8 per cent greater between
1900 and 1910.</p>
<p>The Negroes’ preference for northern residence is even more clearly
shown in the percentage increase of the Negro population by geographic
divisions for ten-year periods from 1880 to 1910. The following table
shows this fact:</p>

<p>The New England, Middle Atlantic and East North Central divisions
have had the largest increases in Negro population with two exceptions,
and these two exceptions may be partly due to the large increase of
Negroes in the Rocky Mountain and Pacific Coast geographical divisions.
It is also significant that the increase during the last two decades has
been greater in the New England, Middle Atlantic and East Central
divisions than the increase of the total Negro population.</p>
<p>The extent of southern territory affected by the migration now in
progress lies mainly east of the Mississippi river. Missouri, Arkansas,
Oklahoma and Texas seem not to have suffered as yet. In fact, some of
the migrants from Mississippi have gone to the rich “cotton-bottoms”
counties of Arkansas along the Mississippi river, and to Oklahoma.
Alabama and Georgia probably have been the biggest losers. Mississippi
probably comes third; Florida probably fourth. The order of other
southern states cannot now be approximately ascertained. However, North
and South Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky and Virginia have all furnished
a considerable quota of the Negro migrants. During the past two years
the writer has made extended visits to cities, towns and rural districts
of all these states and has seen the character and effects of the
movement of Negroes from these sections.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is no means of telling accurately how many have left
the South. Numerical estimates have been made by some persons, based
upon the statements of observers who have watched the trainloads leave,
and upon the growth of numbers in different northern cities. Estimates
based upon the records of insurance companies, railway ticket offices
and of other sources have been made by others. These estimates have
ranged from 250,000 to more than 750,000. The Negro population of some
of the northern centers has increased from about one- to four-fold
during the past eighteen months. For instance, careful estimates show
that the Negro population of Detroit, Mich., has increased from about
6,000 to about 25,000. A conservative estimate at Cincinnati places the
number of those arriving at about 25,000 during twelve months ending
September, 1917. Cincinnati has been a distributing point for other
centers, so that probably less than a fifth stayed in that city. A study
of the Negro Migrant in Pittsburgh by Epstein estimates a “total
probable new Negro population of 18,550 in 1917.” This is an increase of
nearly 50 per cent. Estimates for Philadelphia range from 12,000 to
40,000: “Some weeks they have come almost by the trainload.” Weighing
all the estimates and information from the various sources, it is
probably safe to say that between 400,000 and 500,000 Negroes have
migrated North during the past two years.</p>

<p>These migrants are composed apparently of three types of people.
First, there are the less responsible characters, younger men for the
most part, who readily respond to the promises of high wages and free
transportation made by labor agents. A representative of one large
railroad company reported that in 1916 they chose anyone willing to come
and thus brought up about 13,000 Negro men. They reported they still had
in their employ in January, 1917, less than 2,500 of them. From this
type of migrant develops the “floater” or “bird of passage.”</p>
<p>The second type of migrants consists of the industrious, thrifty,
unskilled workers. Many of them are men with families or other
dependents. They are looking for new homes. The men usually go first to
earn money and look over the ground. Their families soon follow.
Dissatisfied with the low wages, treatment and other conditions of their
southern communities, many of these people accepted offers of work and
free transportation. Considerable numbers had small savings, which were
used to pay their traveling expenses. The writer visited several small
towns in South Carolina and in Alabama, and saw companies of Negroes of
this type leaving. Some parties included wives and children; in some
groups only wives were accompanying their husbands and leaving their
children with relatives. Neighbors were helping them pack their
belongings and were sending them away with farewell greetings.</p>
<p>The third type of Negro migrant consists of skilled artisans business
and professional men who share the dissatisfaction and restlessness of
the southern Negro group. They feel also the necessity of going with the
rank and file on whom they largely depend for patronage. Many of these
people had considerable property. Highly skilled workmen and other new
arrivals are known to have come to Michigan, Ohio and Massachusetts with
fairly large sums of money from the sale of their possessions in the
South. One professional man who had left Georgia summed up the feeling
of this type by saying, “They are thrifty, have accumulated something
out of their meager earnings. … They have gladly sacrificed their
holdings to make this great step in the process of their
emancipation.”</p>
<p>The fact that these three types of migrants have been going North and
that the present migration is only an increase of a movement that has
slowly been in progress for more than a generation leads naturally to a
full discussion of the causes for this mass movement. The forces
producing such an effect must be deep-seated and fundamental.</p>
<p>A study of the problem of migration to both northern and southern
centers as it stood in 1912 and 1913 developed the thesis that the Negro
is in the general population stream, and that, wherever similar causes
operate under conditions similar to those moving the white population,
the Negro, like the Caucasian, is coming to the city to stay. The
divorce of the Negro from the soil and the call of commercial and
industrial centers were the economic influences moving him, then, as
they were moving his white fellow citizens. To these economic forces
were added social and individual causes, such as the strained relations
of landlords and tenants on southern plantations; “Jim Crow” legislation
and other restrictions of <span class="pagenum">117</span>the rights and
privileges of persons of color. Influences such as the coming of labor
agents, going North to join relatives, receipt of letters from those who
had gone, visits from friends and relatives who had previously migrated
North were noted as moving causes.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The dramatic movement to
northern industrial and commercial centers during the past two years has
shown the effects of such forces and restrictions as those
mentioned.</p>

<strong>“these are they with hope in their hearts”</strong><br> The boll
weevil caused this southern colored family to lose their cotton crop in
Florida and they came North chiefly, they say, to give their children
better schooling. The picture was taken shortly after their arrival to
Newark, N.J.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The whites have moved North in large numbers during the same time.
Some of the causes moving the Negroes they have not felt; others they
have. Their movement cannot now be easily traced, but the nativity
figures of the next census may bring some interesting facts to
light.</p>
<p>Observation and information gotten from various sources and during
visits to seven of the southern states in 1916 and 1917 make the motives
of the present migration clear. Those parts of Alabama which suffered
from the effect of the boll-weevil were among those that felt the Negro
migration most. When a month’s rain during the summer of 1916 gave the
knockout stroke to the cotton crops that year, many planters are known
to have advised their tenants to go somewhere to find work because the
landlords could not “furnish them’’ until the next cropping season. The
boll-weevil helped likewise to release the Negroes from the soil of
Mississippi and Georgia. It is a sound inference then that those
districts hard hit by boll-weevil, floods and other economic hardships
for the past two years were among the districts that lost large numbers
of their Negro population.</p>
<p>Simultaneous with these unfavorable economic conditions in southern
districts there came an Unusual demand for labor in northern industrial
centers. As is well known, these industrial centers were formerly
supplied thousands of semi-skilled and unskilled European immigrants.
The great war not only shut off an increase of this supply of laborers
but also called some of those already here to the armies of their
respective nations. At the time that foreigners went to join their
colors, northern manufacturers received an unprecedented demand for war
supplies. Northern railroad authorities, manufacturers and mine
operators went in search of laborers. Imported Mexicans for railroad
work were not successful. By careful selection and direction, one large
railroad company found that <span class="pagenum">118</span> Negroes
were satisfactory. Of about 3,000 brought North in 1916, about
three-fourths were in their employ in 1917.</p>
<p>Soon labor agents were threading the South. They became the means of
spreading information about the northern industrial opportunities,
offering two dollars, three dollars, four dollars and five dollars a
day. To southern Negro workmen who were averaging only one dollar to two
dollars a day, and many of them less, the offers seemed magnificent, and
few questions were asked about the cost of living, housing or other
conditions.</p>
<p>These new economic influences have been important and powerful; they
have not, however, been the only fundamental causes of the exodus. The
Negro has sought larger protection to life and property and larger
liberty. As the University Commission on Southern Race Questions said in
1917 in its Open Letter to the College Men of the South: “The dollar has
lured the Negro to the East and North, as it has lured the white man
even to the most inaccessible and forbidden regions of the earth. But
the human being is moved and held not by money alone. Birthplace,
home-ties, family, friends, associations and attachments of numerous
kinds, fair treatment, opportunity to labor and enjoyment of the
legitimate fruits of labor, assurance of even-handed justice in the
courts, good educational facilities, sanitary living conditions,
tolerance and sympathy—these things and, others like them make an even
stronger appeal to the human mind and heart than does money.”</p>
<p>These words suggest to us another set of fundamental causes which
have moved the Negroes to the North. The Negroes look to “the North” as
to a “promised land” where these benefits may be obtained. This state of
mind is clearly shown in reviewing a large number of letters they have
written to persons in the North asking and urging to be given a chance
to “better their conditions.” These letters express the desire to get a
better job, to have a better home and to live a larger life. From
Majette, Fla., a correspondent writes, “I no it is a good place in the
North”; another from Atlanta, Ga., said, “My ambitions are such that (I)
should be willing to do any kind of decent work in order to realize
them”; another from Appalachia, Va., wrote, “It is a wearisome thing to
work all the time and kan’t see or enjoy the fruits. …I wants to be some
wheres I kin go to night school or day school either one.” Here is one
from Raleigh, N. C.: “Willing to work at anything or place if there is a
chance for advancement.” One from Macon, Ga., said, “I desire to go
North to better my present condition.” Scores of others from various
parts of the South wrote in the same strain.</p>
<p>A survey of the seven states mentioned in a preceding paragraph
shows, furthermore, that those sections which have had lynchings, mobs
and other race disturbances in recent years have lost large numbers of
Negroes. Of course, the revolting cases of injustice at the hands of
mobs occur in different localities at different times and therefore come
directly under the attention of a limited number of Negroes. But two
facts should be clearly understood.</p>
<p>We may look at these two facts in detail. First, the racial friction
and lack of cooperation between many individuals in matters of everyday
concern breed general discontent. The expression of good-will from the
higher impulses of the two races is largely blocked by a multitude of
petty restrictions and injustices that affect hundreds of Negroes in
many localities. The inability to protect themselves against these many
little injustices and indignities of everyday dealing in business and
dvic life is the cause of much unrest and bitter feeling. A typical
condition is shown in a Negro tenant’s reply to an inquiry about his
affairs: “Boss I jes kan’t make enuff to feed my fam’ly.” “You seem to
be pretty much alive,” answered his questioner, “how are you getting
by?” “Why, my landlawd is a’vancin’ [furnishing rations] me. He’s done
got me bought already fur nex’ yeah.” A bit of doggerel from the cotton
fields shows the state of mind produced in the Negro:</p>
<div class="verse">
<ul>
<li>De white man he got ha’f de crap [crop].</li>
<li>Boll-weevill took de res’.</li>
<li>Ain’t got no home,</li>
<li>Ain’t got no home.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>And at the first suggestion he is ready to go North to try to find a
home.</p>

Garment Co., in Detroit. Mich.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The fee system and lack of defense for the Negro in the inferior
courts is also a great source of dissatisfaction and a great barrier to
good-will. So generally is the court situation understood that some
white men in one southern city have proposed starting a legal defense
league with payments like industrial insurance to employ able lawyers to
represent defenseless Negroes in the courts. Negroes also regard the
denial of a voice in the government to which they pay taxes and to <span
class="pagenum">119</span> which they loyally give themselves and their
treasures in every emergency as another very serious matter.</p>
<figure>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Negro has shown himself worthy of the measures of justice and
expressions of good-will from his white fellow citizens. He has never
attempted to assassinate an official of the government. He has never
organized a strike when his country was at war. He has never been guilty
of burning homes, arsenals, grain elevators and munition plants, even
when war was being waged about his own enslavement. He would not poison
or put glass into foodstuffs, or blow up hospital ships. He has given
his blood and treasure in every war. Yet Negroes are lynched, burned at
the stake and mobbed with impunity North and South, besides suffering
the general exploitation of the weak the world over. Of course,
conditions in different localities vary. In some sections relations of
the races are amicable, and daily affairs move along in a more contented
stream. The border states and the tide-water have many such
communities.</p>
<p>In some sections of the South the best white citizens are voicing
their belief in the Negro’s worth and their conviction against mob
violence. For example, a statement was published recently in Memphis and
Nashville signed by Bishop Gailor, Episcopal Bishop of Tennessee; by W.
H. Litty, the mayor of Memphis; by Bolton Smith and Charles Haase, two
prominent business men of Memphis. They said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are enlisting Negroes in our armies by the hundred thousand and
sending them to France to fight for us. The Negroes furnish most of the
labor for our farms and in our homes. We want them to stay in the South.
Thoughtful southern men, who know conditions, want to give the good and
respectable Negro a fair deal, and protect him in his life, liberty and
property, and so encourage him to live and work among us. We believe
that the mobs, who are yielding to their mad passions are working a
terrible injury to the peace and prosperity of our country, and
especially to this section of it. <br> <br>Some of us are determined,
therefore, to create if possible, a public opinion, that is just and
enlightened, and that will frown down this evil; and with this in view,
we ask you to meet with some of your fellow citizens on Friday, March 8,
at 5 p. m., in Committee Room A, second floor, Chamber of Commerce, and
discuss ways and means.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We may now consider the second fact in these reactions and opinions
of Negroes about southern conditions. Negroes are more and more reading
the white and Negro newspapers. The vivid descriptions of lynchings,
mobs and other race disturbances are glaringly set forth in these
newspapers. Little is said in the white press of the cooperation and
good will between the races and the many excellent achievements of the
Negroes. In homes, in barber-shops, pool-rooms and other places these
accounts are read and discussed by Negroes. They make and leave the
impression of insecurity to liberty, life and property. Certain
lynchings in South Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee, in 1916, 1917 and
1918 were widely reported and discussed in Negro newspapers and
periodicals. Not only vivid descriptions of the facts but also vigorous
editorials against such outrages were widely circulated. Thousands of
Negroes directly or indirectly all over the South felt the disturbance
of mind produced by such occurrences. In the mind of the average Negro
it is not the probability of being assaulted on slight provocation with
little chance for defense or of being mobbed whether guilty or not, with
no opportunity to prove an alibi, but it is the possibility of either
occurrence that makes life and liberty uncertain and happiness
impossible.</p>
<p>That the average southern Negro says little or nothing in protest
against these injustices is no evidence that he does not feel them and
remember them. His protest is not of the militant, Anglo-Saxon type. At
his first opportunity he “folds his tent like the Arab and as silently
steals away.” Scores of illustrations are available to show that the
Negro has reacted to the situation and is in a dissatisfied state of
mind. The interpretation of a Negro in Mississippi is that the Negro has
two privileges—“ter pay his taxes and ter git out o’ de road.”</p>
<p>It is no exaggeration to say that the feeling of dissatisfaction with
such conditions is widespread. Conversations with Negro leaders,
artisans, laborers, railroad porters, farmers, tenants and field-hands
have left this strong inference. Other persons besides the writer
furnished some of the reports of these conversations. One of the
foremost Negro leaders said: “The present administration of law in the
South removes from the colored man the hope of protection in the right
and from the white man the fear of punishment in wrong. This is a fact
of mal-adjustment that double crosses both races.” One southern white
man says, “The striking fact was the uniformity of the answers given by
country Negroes and by Negro leaders alike. And fully half of the
representative white men with whom I talked agreed with the Negroes.”
This does not mean that the masses of Negroes have done any great
reflection and philosophizing about the race problem. They have not.
They have merely felt pain and the <span class="pagenum">120</span>
pleasure of everyday life in their own localities. They have made
immediate reactions to these concrete conditions. And many of them, when
the chance came, silently moved away. A southern field-hand showed his
idea of the cause of these reactions by singing as he followed the
plow:</p>
<div class="verse">
<ul>
<li>Boll-weevil in de cotton,</li>
<li>Cut wurm in de cawn [corn]</li>
<li>Debil in de white man,</li>
<li>Wah’s [war it] goin’ on.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The education of their children is another matter which is disturbing
the Negroes. During the past twenty years a widespread and well managed
propaganda has been made to arouse the Negroes of the South, especially
the rural population, to educate their children. In public mass meetings
and conferences, in pulpits, in pamphlets and in the Negro press, in
season and out of season, the importance of educating their children has
been thoroughly impressed upon them. They have sought the facilities
with which to do it. In most sections of the South these are very
inadequate.</p>
<p>The large body of facts presented in the Report on Negro Education by
Thomas Jesse Jones, issued recently by the United States Bureau of
Education, leaves no doubt about the meager educational provision for
these millions. This report says: “Public schools for Negroes have
shared comparatively little in the educational advance that has taken
place in the southern states during the past 15 years. … Teachers’
salaries for each child 6 to 14 years of age range from $15.78 to $36.50
for all pupils in the northern and western states represented in this
table [p. 23, Vol. I of the report], and from $5.27 to $13.79 for white
pupils and from $1.44 to $8.53 for colored pupils in the southern states
here listed. It is important to note in studying these figures that the
South is maintaining a double system of schools on finances limited both
by the poverty of rural conditions and by an ineffective system of
taxation.” Improvements have been made through cooperation of the state
departments of education and the General Education Board in the
maintenance of state supervisors of Negro schools, and through the work
of the Jeanes Rural School Fund, the Slater Fund and the Rosenwald rural
school building activities. But these improvements have necessarily
touched as yet only a limited number of places; they take time, and the
masses of the Negroes know of them only here and there. They think of
the miserable schools they see and hear much of magnificent provisions
in the North.</p>
<p>After all this movement of the southern Negro population someone
asks, What is going to be the outcome? What is going to be done in the
South? The South has seen the Negro laborer in a new light and is
setting a new value upon his labor. Wages have been raised in many
parts. The increase in many sections has been small. It has not kept
pace in most cases with the high cost of living; but wages have been
raised. Many plantation owners are reported as having expressed their
intention of making and as having taken steps to make some improvement
in their methods of dealing with tenants. The touching of the pocket
nerve is calling forth response. The sense of justice and fair play is
asserting itself also among the liberal and enlightened white citizens.
Negroes in many localities agree that the treatment received at the
hands of white people has improved.</p>
<p>A most significant thing in this connection is the effect of the
liberal, fair dealing and good treatment of some employers preceding the
present migration. Case after case of such employers has come to the
writer’s knowledge. They have not suffered so seriously from loss of
employees as have others in the same locality. For example, some
employers in the Birmingham industrial district and some in the Virginia
tidewater have suffered comparatively little from loss of laborers. The
wages of these firms have been reasonably advanced from time to time;
and a policy of fair, liberal treatment from bosses and superintendents
has been the rule for years. Planters in Georgia and Mississippi of the
same liberal type have had similar experience.</p>
<p>Practically every southern state has attempted to stop the migration
by laws against labor agents. Many of the states already had laws to
regulate or prohibit the exodus of laborers through the activity of
labor agents. Some of these were revised and new ones passed.<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The laws have usually taken two
forms: excessive labor agents’ license or requirements of residence. One
state law passed in 1917 has a unique provision which requires the agent
or agents to make surety that each laborer removed from the state shall
not return as a charity charge.</p>
<p>School authorities are gradually awaking to the need of better school
provision. One member of a county school board said, “We propose to
improve the Negro schools in the same proportion and manner as the white
schools.” The strongest public statement at a national conference on
Negro education held under the auspices of the Bureau of Education last
August was an expression for justice to Negroes in public education
which was made by the state superintendent of education of Louisiana.
This state has very large illiteracy among Negroes.</p>
<p>Perhaps the two most far-reaching and encouraging accompaniments of
the migration movement are the beginning of frankness and plainness of
speech by the leading white southern newspapers and of southern white
men and women, and the open conferences and frank conversations between
the thinking men and women of both races in the South. A summary of
interviews had by several persons with editors of thirty-one leading
newspapers in eighteen cities of eight southern states shows that nearly
all of these editors are in sympathy with liberal views of democratic
justice for Negroes. Many of these editors have embraced the times and
have given expression to views quite in advance of the conventional
opinions of their communities. The high-water mark has been touched by a
number of them.</p>
<p>Commenting on the Houston riots, the Memphis
<em>Commercial-Appeal</em> said: “The peace depends upon the conduct and
intelligence of the white people. … We have the big advantage of
education, and we have other advantages. Therefore the duty rests upon
white people to see that there is peace and order.” The Richmond
<em>Times-Dispatch</em> said: “The South needs the Negro, and to keep
him must be just to him.” The Nashville <em>Tennessean and American</em>
in an editorial on Negro migration said: “Then, having made higher wages
the main material of our dam, we must throw in a rip-rap of better
treatment. Something ought to be done about better housing conditions. …
But bullying, bulldozing and blustering on the part of officers will
have to stop. The officer who manhandles or mistreats a Negro who is
behaving himself is not worth nearly as much to the community as the
Negro. … The Negro is not to be blamed for going. The North is not to be
blamed for asking him to go. … All the blame falls upon the southern
people, who permit conditions that will allow the Negro to be lured
away.” In an editorial against mob violence, the Nashville
<em>Banner</em> said: “It is not the Negro’s fault that he is here. … He
is a native of this soil as much as the whites. He is a human being and
he is entitled to full recognition of his living rights and his
humanity. He is in many ways exceedingly useful. The South needs <span
class="pagenum">121</span> his labor and prefers it to any other. There
is serious objection to his emigration, and without any regard to his
social and political status, he is entitled to humane treatment and the
full protection of the law. Anything else reflects on white people and
works to their detriment more than it does to that of the Negro.”
Commenting on a sermon on suppression of lynching, the Atlanta
<em>Constitution</em> said: “In mob violence and the spirit of the mob
there is nothing that a law-abiding citizen can condone; nor that is not
repulsive and abhorrent. If we are going to have mob rule, we may as
well abolish our courts. But we are not going to abolish our courts, and
therefore we have got to abolish the mob.”</p>
Gradually the silence of the liberal South is being broken. The
conscience of this class is speaking its highest convictions. No less
important than press utterances have been the statements of white
southerners in public addresses and public gatherings. Two notable
utterances were voiced the summer of 1917 at the Law and Order
Conference of White Southerners held at Blue Ridge, N. C., and in the
meeting of the University Commission on Southern Race Questions in
Washington, D. C. In the letter mentioned in a preceding paragraph the
University Race Commission said: “The South

<p>cannot compete on a financial basis with other sections of the
country for the labor of the Negro, but the South can easily keep her
Negroes against all allurements if she will give them a large measure of
those things that human beings hold dearer than material goods.” The
Blue Ridge Conference said in a resolution: “We pledge to each other and
to the people of both white and black races in the South our utmost
endeavors to allay hurtful race prejudice, to promote mutual
understanding, sympathy and good-will, to procure economic justice, and
in particular to condemn and oppose all forms of mob violence.”</p>
<p>Recent lynchings in Tennessee have led not only to vigorous protests
from the white press, pulpit and individuals, but has resulted in the
formation of a Law and Order League for the suppression of mob violence.
(Reported in the Survey of March 16.) Starting in a local organization
at Nashville and composed of the leading business and professional men,
the movement in less than a month has drawn white men from all over the
state. Representatives of thirty-three cities, towns and counties of the
state met and formed a statewide organization. They propose to create a
public opinion by means of literature, lectures and the press and to
secure enforcement of existing laws and the enactment, of new ones by
all lawful meanfc to stop these outrages. Their proclamation rings with
conviction and decision for action. One sentence shows its quality: “We
have a strong conviction that lynching is unjustifiable under any and
all circumstances, and is wrong in the sight of man and in the sight of
God.”</p>

<p>Reports of many private conversations and conferences of white and
colored citizens show that many white people with open minds are talking
with Negroes and inquiring what may be done to accord what they now
agree is simple justice to Negroes. Many of the Negro spokesmen are
saying frankly what they believe to be the mind of the group and what
they want as a just share of democratic advantages of wages, hours and
conditions of work, schools and protection of “life, liberty, property
and the pursuit of happiness.” One report from Alabama stated that, at a
conference, a Negro farmer in trying to express the desires of his
people said to the leading white banker who was presiding, “And, sir,
we, we wants the ballot fer to help say who governs us.” When the banker
replied that the good citizens of the state proposed to see that their
desires were met, the Negroes present rose in a body and applauded
loudly.</p>
<p>Perhaps in these stirring days when “the old order changeth, giving
place to new,” no other one thing has made more for the improvement of
race relations in the South than the readiness with which Negroes have
responded to the national draft law. Southern newspapers have said they
responded more readily than the whites in many localities. To the rank
and file of Negroes the present world war means a war for freedom. They
see in it a promise of greater freedom for all weaker peoples,
themselves included. The departure of the drafted colored men has given
evidence of the newer cordial relations between the races that is
developing. Many localities have made the departure of the Negro
conscripts a festal day. In Birmingham and in Mobile, Ala., the leading
citizens took charge of the ceremonies, and the Confederate veterans
headed the procession of Negro recruits as they marched to the railroad
station to entrain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">122</span> The sequel of the migration, then,
is bearing fruit by making for better wages, better treatment of Negro
laborers, a more liberal expression of opinion from the southern press
and from white leaders a freer exchange of views between the white and
Negro leaders and action for law and order. These changes will surely
bring greater amity and contentment to the South, white and black, and
thus make, migration unnecessary.</p>
<p>In closing an account of the southern part of this important
movement, one may venture to propose a few constructive plans:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Progressive Negroes in the South may use the present time for frank
interviews with white people with whom they have business and personal
relations.</li>
<li>It is a most expedient time for the thinking persons of color to get
together and in closer touch with the masses of their own people. They
can help them to understand the economic and community questions
involved in the present national situation and help to organize
themselves for race advancement.</li>
<li>The local committees and conferences of white and colored people
that have sprung up spontaneously should now be purposely planned and
organized with a definite program of community betterment for Negroes.
Progressive white citizens will readily find capable, devoted Negro
leaders, if they make known their willingness to cooperate with them for
community improvement. Racial cooperation should become a community
program.</li>
<li>The community needs of the colored people are definite and concrete.
The following things can be done by the two races working together in
almost every locality: improvement of wages, tenant conditions on the
farms and labor conditions in industrial enterprises; betterment of
housing, health and sanitary conditions; promotion of justice in the
courts; extension of civil rights and privileges on an impartial basis;
the moulding of sentiment against mob violence and the promotion of
legislation to insure obedience to law and order; the improvement of the
Negro schools and the development of a better understanding on the part
of both the Negro and the white man of the feelings and aspirations of
each race.</li>
<li>The opportunity for the training in general intelligence and for
full experience in all the business, professional, philanthropic and
civic affairs of community life should be afforded the large number of
capable Negroes now eager to serve their people and their country. An
essential part of this work is to recognize, encourage and support the
good work being done by a number of the struggling Negro colleges and
schools of the South.</li>
<li>No greater step could now be made in race adjustment than widespread
response. North and South, to the strong movement for law and order
started in Nashville in February. It has already spread to other parts
of Tennessee.</li>
</ol>
<p>White and Negro citizens have formed organizations to carry on such
activities in both rural districts and urban centers in several parts of
the South. These examples demonstrate that such a plan will work. It
will speed up the progressive changes taking place in the South. It will
increase the number of southern white persons who believe in fair play
for the Negro and will stimulate public opinion in the same direction.
It will tend to satisfy the Negroes of the South by removing the causes
for their departure. It will help toward that democratic adjustment of
race relations so essential to the future of the nation and so vital to
the future of civilization.</p>
