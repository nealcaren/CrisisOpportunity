<p><span class="pagenum">204</span> When we turn to the study of
juvenile delinquency we find, as in the case of desertions and
illegitimacy, that Negroes furnish a disproportionate number of cases in
most cities for which statistics are available. In New York City the
proportion of Negro children arraigned in the Children’s Court increased
from 4.2 per cent in 1919 to 8 per cent in 1925, although the Negro
population was only 2.7 per cent of the total in 1920.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> In
Indianapolis, Gary, and Dayton the proportion of Negro cases was from
three to four times as large as their relative numbers in the
population. Likewise, in three southern cities, Richmond, Memphis, and
Charleston, South Carolina, Negroes furnished about one and a half times
as large a proportion of the delinquency cases as their relative numbers
in the population of these cities.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Juvenile delinquency among the Negroes of Chicago has shown the same
tendency as in other northern cities. Since 1900 there has been an
increase in the proportion of Negro cases. This increase has been most
marked since the migrations from the South during and since the World
War. In 1925 nearly a fifth of the boys and girls brought into the
Juvenile Court were Negroes. Not all of the cases of juvenile
delinquency were brought into the court. In 1926 there were 1,322 Negro
boys arrested for juvenile delinquency, <span class="pagenum">205</span>
although only 320 cases were taken to the court. In 1927 the number of
arrests had increased to 1,503.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"

<p>The increase in the number of Negro delinquents has followed the
movement of the Negro population into the areas which have been
characterized by a high delinquency rate. Clifford R. Shaw says in this
connection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The white Protestants, most of whom are native born, have in the
process of the growth of Chicago, gradually moved out of the areas of
deterioration where the rate of delinquency is high. The Negro on the
<span class="pagenum">206</span> other hand, because of his lower
economic status, has tended to move into the area of deterioration near
the “Loop,” thus supplanting to a certain extent the white Protestant
population in this area. The increase in the percentage of the Negro
cases brought to court may be due to some extent to the type of area in
which this racial group is forced to live.<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>The high delinquent rate which has characterized the area near the
Loop, where a large part of the Negro population has found a foothold in
the city, has existed over a period of thirty years “notwithstanding the
fact that the [racial] composition has changed markedly.”<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Moreover, Shaw’s studies of delinquency have indicated that there
were variations in the rates of delinquency for <span
class="pagenum">209</span> different sections of the Negro community. In
computing rates of delinquency for one-mile intervals along the main
thoroughfares radiating from the Loop, he found that the decline in
rates along the radial passing through the area occupied by the Negro
population was similar to that in the case of other radials.<a
href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Variations in the rates of juvenile
delinquency in the Negro population, when studied alone, were brought
out when the Negro cases were distributed in the community and rates
worked out for the seven zones into which we have divided the community.
The variations in the rates of delinquency showed the same trend, which
we have found in the case of dependency, desertions, illegitimacy, and
other indexes of family and social disorganization.<a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>
Moreover, the decline in the rates of juvenile delinquency showed a
trend similar to the variations in the rates of adult delinquency in
these areas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">209</span> In the first zone near the “Loop,”
where deterioration and the encroachment of business and industry were
forcing the <span class="pagenum">210</span> Negro families further
south, the thirty-three boys who were arrested for juvenile delinquency
in 1926 represented over two-fifths of the boys from ten to seventeen
years of age in the area. In this same area 10 per cent of the adult
Negro males were in the County Jail in 1921.<a href="#fn9"

<p>A decided decrease in the delinquency rate appeared in the fifth zone
where police probation officers had complaints against 15 per cent of
the boys. In the sixth zone, as in the case of family desertion and
illegitimacy, the delinquency rate continued to decline sharply, and in
the seventh zone less than 2 per cent of the boys had complaints brought
against them for delinquency.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">211</span> The highest rates of juvenile
delinquency were in those areas of the Negro community which were
characterized, as we have seen, by deterioration and social
disorganization. In these areas the customary forms of social control in
the Negro group tended to decay, family discipline disappeared,
especially in the case of the many broken homes, and even the
well-organized families lost much of their influence over the behavior
of the children.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Many of the boys took over from
other boys and gangs the patterns of delinquent behavior that
characterized these areas. The vicious and delinquent patterns of
behavior, which have become traditional in the sections of cities where
large numbers of Negroes are generally forced to live, are often
transmitted to the stable Negro families. A Negro social worker from a
good family background wrote the following concerning the influence of
the vicious behavior, in the community where she was reared, on her
younger sisters, one of whom became delinquent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When our neighborhood began to be more thickly populated it became
known as the “red light district” for white sporting people. As the city
grew they were always being forced farther out and as this was the edge
of the city they were permitted to live in this vicinity. I remember
when my mother would go away from home my sisters would make believe
they were sporting people and roll up newspapers <span
class="pagenum">212</span> and pretend they were smoking cigarettes and
even try to imitate their language by swearing.<a href="#fn13"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The case of a delinquent boy in the third zone shows the relationship
between the family situation and the community background and the high
delinquency rate in this area. We give first the following brief summary
of the boy’s delinquent career:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In March, 1926, M⸺ T⸺, 12 years 7 months, was arraigned with three
other boys older than himself for breaking into a fish market at 33
South State Street one evening in January. They entered the market by
breaking the glass in the rear door and secured a watch and steel
revolver, besides damaging the telephone box. They gave the watch and
revolver to a man named G⸺ who was supposed to room at 31 Prairie
Avenue. This man promised to pay them but did not. They also admitted
burglarizing a flat on West 36th Street where they got a watch and a
revolver. They sold the watch to A⸺ A⸺ , 11 years old, and the gun to L⸺
J⸺ , 15 years old, getting $1.00 for each. The case was continued until
the father of one of the boys could be secured. In October M⸺ T⸺ was
arrested in Gary and charged with the larceny of an automobile. He had
been a source of trouble during his parole in Chicago. His mother
brought him to the Juvenile Court and asked that he be placed in the
Detention Home. He was sent there but escaped after two attempts. He was
caught and returned a week later and sent to St. Charles School for
Boys. In May, 1927, he was again sent to St. Charles for attempted
burglary of a Standard Oil Station. In each case he was in the company
of the same boys. In January, 1930, he was arrested on suspicion for
attempting to rob a meat truck but was released on February 2nd. He was
returned home but left within a few hours and was not heard from again
until February 10th when he was shot through the arm while he and five
others were attempting to hold up a store. He was sent to the
Bridewell.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">213</span> The boy, M⸺, was born in Jackson,
Mississippi, in 1913 and was taken to Washington, D.C., when he was five
years old. After the family, consisting of his father, mother, two
sisters, and a brother, all three younger than himself, had remained in
Washington six years, they came to Chicago. The father was employed at
unskilled work while the mother engaged in day work. Neither parent was
at home from six in the morning until five-thirty in the afternoon. The
mother told the following story of the beginning of the boy’s
delinquencies soon after coming to Chicago.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We were living at and there was a boy who used to come over to see
M⸺. Him and this boy was great friends so one day— one Sunday it was, I
had gone to church and was on my way back and when they saw me coming
they ran. I had about fifteen dollars in a little bank and they had
thrown it out of the back window in the alley and ran down the stairs
and got it and went off. Of course M⸺ says the other boy did it so the
boy’s mamma gave me his part back. That was about a year after we came
to Chicago and ever since then M⸺ has been doing something. He has a
gang of boys that he goes around with and I can’t do anything with him.
He began when he was about twelve years old to stay away from home and
school. I would send him to school and he would even go to school but
jest as soon as that gang, what he would run around with, would come by
and whistle he would get an excuse and leave. I did not know this until
one day I was going over to my sister’s house and I saw him and a whole
bunch of boys going under the tressel when I thought he was at school.
Well then, I walks fast and catches him and takes him home and got after
him about running away from school and he said that the boys came by for
him and he went. I then goes to the school and asks the teacher about
him and she said that he had been staying out of school for a long time
and whenever he did come, and she would ask him where he had been, he
would tell her that his mother had kept him out to go places for her and
there I didn’t even know that he had not been to school. When we first
came to Chicago and M⸺ would be out late in the <span
class="pagenum">214</span> night playing, I told Mr. T⸺ that he ought
not to let M⸺ stay out so late playing around with these boys here and
he would say “0 let the boy play.”<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are several important factors that should be noted concerning
the origin of the boy’s delinquency. The absence of both father and
mother from the home during the greater part of the day prevented the
development of common interests and the sharing of a common experience.
There was a difference of opinion, which led to conflict, between the
parents themselves over the restrictions that should be placed on the
boy’s playing at night. The attempt of the father by the use of severe
corporal punishment to force the boy to remain at home and to attend
school regularly only accentuated his dislike of home and opposition to
parental control. As the younger brother told the investigator: “You
know the reason M⸺ don’t come home? Papa used to whip him every time he
would stay off. Mamma says that is what is the matter now. He never
whips me much because I don’t do anything but go to school.” The younger
brother’s statement was confirmed by the mother in the presence of the
father. When the latter excused his whipping the boy severely because he
wanted him to stay at home and go to school, adding, “I’d give anything
if he’d just do that; so that’s why I whipped him. I tried to get him to
see it that way but I could not,” the mother replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, but there was no need to kill him because you couldn’t get him
your way after he had already gone wrong. Honest its the truth,
sometimes Mr. T⸺ wouldn’t even know that I was out of bed—out in the
cold and snow looking for M⸺ and he would be home sleeping without a
care, it seems, and as soon as I would get the child home and call him
and tell him I had found our boy, he would jump up and go to beating
him. Why he got so bad at it until even our neighbors <span
class="pagenum">215</span> would tell me to ask him not to beat the
child so much but to talk to him some and maybe that would help. I tried
to tell him that myself but it didn’t do any good. Why it was awful, he
got so bad until he even hit me one night because I tried to stop him
and that’s when I told him that it could not go on any longer—it was too
much.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The area in which this family had lived since coming to Chicago has
long been characterized by vice and crime. The area has deteriorated
considerably and most of the Negroes in this area live in tenements and
dilapidated two flats and frame buildings. During the little over five
years that the family has been in Chicago, they have lived in five
places in this same area. During this time the boy has been transferred
from one school to another. The constant moving about in this area is
characteristic of the families who live there. In the absence of an
attractive home environment the boy spent most of his time in the
streets. As we have noted before, this area lacks any form of
neighborhood organization or communal life. The boy became a member, at
first, of the play groups and later of an organized gang in the area and
took over the patterns of delinquent behavior that characterized these
groups.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> It was in these groups rather than
in the family group that the boy acquired his aims and conceptions of
life. This was seen in the mother’s report of the boy’s opinion of one
of the leaders of the gang of which he was a member.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">216</span> There is a bunch of boys that he
runs around with and we can not keep him away from them. He told me that
G⸺ C⸺ had a head on him of which any man would be proud. M⸺ says that
boy can take a bunch of fellows in a store and walk up to the
storekeeper and go to talking and those fellows can get anything they
want. You see that’s the bunch he ran into and we simply can’t stop him
now.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Sometimes, especially in this zone, the boy’s delinquency not only
reflected the criminal behavior that characterized this area but the
criminal conduct of his parents. This was the situation in the case of a
ten-year-old boy, who was first brought into court by his mother in 1924
because “he was beyond her control.” About a year previously a foster
grandmother had reported the boy’s mother to the court for neglect of
him and immoral conduct. As the result of the boy’s truancy and
desertion of the home in 1924 he was placed in the Parental School. In
1927, when the boy was thirteen, he was brought into the court on the
charge of burglary. This charge had followed several other
delinquencies, in the company of three other boys, and detention in the
Cook County School twice and the Chicago Parental School several
times.</p>
<p>A brief recital of some of the outstanding facts in the boy’s family
background will enable one to see how his delinquent and later criminal
career grew out of the criminal behavior of his mother and stepfather.<a
href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> His mother and father were married
in New Orleans in 1911, and in 1913 came to Chicago where the boy was
bom the following year. Immediately after the family migrated to the
city the father secured a job with a construction company. When he
became ill the mother was forced to take in washing and iron<span
class="pagenum">217</span>ing and do day work. She placed the child with
his foster grandmother. After the father recovered, the grandmother
secured a court order requiring him to pay her $10 for the child’s
support. But the father did not assume responsibility for the family and
left the city. In 1923 the father was placed in a sanitarium where he
died in March leaving the family without any money. The mother married
again the following year. Soon after she was forced to work she
discovered that she could find less laborious and more profitable means
of making a living by selling narcotics and engaging in other criminal
practices characteristic of this zone. When her trade in narcotics was
broken up by the police, she wandered about the country to escape
arrest. She was finally arrested in Chicago, but escaped imprisonment,
according to her story, by paying out a large sum. She then began to
sell liquor. When this was also broken up by the police, she began to
sell “policy,” a lottery scheme popular in some sections of the Negro
community. The boy has been mixed up in his mother’s criminal career
helping her, especially, to sell “policy.” The mother’s attitude toward
the boy’s delinquency has been simply that her son should wait until he
is older in order that he can carry on criminal practices in a more
systematic way and escape detection. As she said: “If ⸺(her son) would
just wait awhile ‘till he gets older, I would get him in the racket and
we would all be settin’ pretty. He is out with my policy books now and I
don’t know whether I am going to get them back or not.” The decline in
delinquency for the last three zones at the southern end of the Negro
community accompanied the progressive stabilization of family life, the
decrease in social disorganization, and a growth in communal life. In
the seventh zone from which boys were seldom brought into <span
class="pagenum">218</span> the court and where there were only five
arrests for delinquency in 1926, the large number of home-owning
families representing the higher occupational classes in the Negro
community have endeavored to keep the area free from disorder through
their neighborhood organization. But the poorer and more disorganized
families have gradually filtered in from the other areas and delinquency
has been on the increase. In 1927 complaints were brought against
sixteen boys and other signs of disorder had begun to appear.</p>
<p>Negroes in Chicago, as in many cities, contribute a disproportionate
amount of juvenile delinquency. In the case of Chicago, juvenile
delinquency among Negroes has been increasing especially since the World
War. It has increased as Negroes have moved into those areas of Chicago
which have been distinguished by a high rate of juvenile delinquency for
a period of thirty years, in spite of marked changes in the racial
composition of these areas during this period. This fact indicates the
close relationship between the community situation and juvenile
delinquency. This relationship was further emphasized by the fact that
the rates of delinquency showed wide variations in the Negro community.
It was high in the areas of deterioration where the poorer migrants from
the South settled chiefly and in the area which was distinguished by
crime, vice, and other forms of social disorganization. The rate of
delinquency decreased considerably for the successive zones marking the
expansion of the Negro community. In the seventh zone, where the higher
occupational classes were concentrated and normal family groups occupied
single-family houses, many of which they owned, juvenile delinquency in
the Negro population tended to disappear. While the areas of high
delinquency rates were differentiated from the areas <span
class="pagenum">219</span> of low rates in regard to their physical
character, the occupational status and the literacy of their
inhabitants, home ownership, dependency, family desertion and
non-support, and illegitimacy, these differences reflected fundamental
differences in culture in the Negro group. For in no respect were these
areas more sharply differentiated than in regard to family tradition, or
in respect to the extent to which the culture of one generation was
transmitted to the succeeding generation.</p>

Research. The addresses of boys arrested during 1926 were spotted on
maps (see Maps XII and XIII). In some cases the boys were arrested as
often as six times. The frequency of arrests is indicated by variations
in the symbols.<a href="#fnref8" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn10"><p>The rate of delinquency for the first zone might have
been exaggerated since a small error in the estimation of the population
for 1926 would greatly increase the delinquency rate in the small
population of this area.<a href="#fnref10" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn11"><p>For the period, January 1, 1923, to June 1, 1924, only
two boys from the sixth zone and none from the seventh zone were brought
before the Juvenile Court. During the same period, Roseland and
Englewood were also free from Juvenile Court cases. Morgan Park had only
three cases. See Table XVI, Appendix B.<a href="#fnref11"

<li id="fn12"><p>In a recent study of delinquent and neglected Negro
children in New York City it was shown that the most common charges
against the boys were disorderly conduct and the desertion of home and
in the cases of the girls approximately 85 per cent of them were charged
with desertion of home and ungovernable and wayward conduct, while,
among the whites, stealing and burglary were the most common charges
(<em>Study Delinquent and Neglected Children before the New York City
Children’s Court in 1925,</em> Joint Committee on Negro Child Study [New
York, 1927], p. 6).<a href="#fnref12" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn17"><p>“There is sufficient material already available to
indicate rather clearly that the spontaneous play group and the more
highly organized gang are important factors in the problem of
delinquency. In a study of six thousand stealing cases coming before the
Juvenile Court of Cook County, it was found that in 90.4 per cent of the
cases two or more boys were involved in the act. In many of these groups
delinquency becomes a traditional form of behavior and is transmitted
from the older to the younger members of the group” (Clifford R. Shaw,
<em>The Jack-Roller</em> [Chicago, 1930], p. 10).<a href="#fnref17"
