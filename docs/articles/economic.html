<p><span class="pagenum">127</span>What are the questions in the present
problem of the economic status of the Negro American? They may be summed
up in four groups:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The relation of the Negro to city and country.</li>
<li>The relation of the Negro to group and national economy.</li>
<li>The influence of race prejudice.</li>
<li>The question of efficiency.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="city-and-country">City and Country</h2>
<p>A fact of great importance in regard to the economic conditions of
the Negro American is his cityward movement. According to the Thirteenth
Census 2,689,229 or 27.3 per <span class="pagenum">128</span>cent of the
Negroes in the United States lived in urban centers in 1910, a decided
increase over 1900. The cityward movement of the Negro is explained
by:<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The divorce of the Negro from the soil.</li>
<li>The trend of the Negro to industrial and commercial centers.</li>
<li>Secondary or individual causes:
<ol type="a">
<li>Attractiveness of urban centers.</li>
<li>Labor legislation.</li>
<li>Desire for economic improvement.</li>
<li>Family relationships.</li>
<li>Desire to escape from restrictive and oppressive legislation and
social customs.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>This means an intensifying of the urban economic problem. This group
of 2,689,229 town Negroes presents preeminently all of the economic
problems outside of those connected with land holding and
agriculture.</p>
<p>Moreover, the city Negroes include more than a third of the
intelligent Negroes of the United States and have a rate of illiteracy
of probably less than 25 per cent. Unquestionably it is in the city that
the more intricate problems of economic life and race contact are going
to be fought out. On the other hand, the very presence of seven million
Negroes in the country districts makes the economic problem there, tho
simple in quality, of tremendous proportions in quantity and of added
significance when we see how the country is feeding the city
problems.</p>
<h2 id="group-economy-and-national-economy">Group Economy and National
Economy</h2>
<p>Present conditions show that while the force of competition from
without is of tremendous economic importance in the economic development
of the Negro American it is by no means final. In an isolated country
the industry of the inhabitants can be supported and developed by means
of a protecting tariff until the country is able to enter into
international trade with fully developed resources; that a similar thing
can be accomplished in a group not wholly isolated but living scattered
among more numerous and richer neighbors is often forgotten. There is
therefore a double question in <span class="pagenum">129</span>regard to
the Negro’s economic advance. The first question is: How far is the
Negro likely to gain a foothold as one of the economic factors in the
nation’s industrial organization? The second is: How far can the Negro
develop a group economy which will so break the force of race prejudice
that his right and ability to enter the national economy are
assured?</p>
<h2 id="race-prejudice">Race Prejudice</h2>
<p>Race prejudice, more than any other single factor, retards the
Negroes’ development in the economic world. Outside of all question of
ability an American of Negro descent will find more or less concerted
effort on the part of his white neighbors:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>To keep him from all positions of authority.</li>
<li>To prevent his promotion to higher grades.</li>
<li>To exclude him entirely from certain lines of industry.</li>
<li>To prevent him from competing upon equal terms with white
workingmen.</li>
<li>To prevent his buying land.</li>
<li>To prevent his defence of his economic rights and status by the
ballot.</li>
</ol>
<p>Efforts in these directions have been prest with varying degrees of
emphasis and have had varying degrees of success. Yet they must all be
taken into account in any economic study of the Negro American. Strikes
have repeatedly occurred against Negro firemen, of whose ability there
was no complaint. The white office boy, errand boy, section hand,
locomotive fireman all have before them the chance to become clerk or
manager or to rise in railway service. The Negro has few such openings.
Fully half of the trade unions in the United States, counted by
numerical strength, exclude Negroes from membership and thus usually
prevent them from working at the trade. Another fourth of the unions
while admitting a few black men here and there practically exclude most
of them. In only a few unions, mostly unskilled, is the Negro welcomed,
as in the case of the miners. In a few others the economic foothold of
the Negro has been good enough to prevent his expulsion, as in some of
the <span class="pagenum">130</span>building trades. Agitation to
prevent the selling of land to Negroes has for a long time been evident
over large districts of the South and is still spreading. In an Atlanta
campaign in the not far distant past the most telling cartoon for the
influence of white voters was one which represented the house of a
particular candidate in process of erection by black men. The black vote
was of course disfranchised in this contest, as it is in a large part of
the South.</p>
<h2 id="negro-efficiency">Negro Efficiency</h2>
<p>The last element in the economic condition of the Negro is the great
question of efficiency. How efficient a laborer is the Negro and how
efficient can he become with intelligent technical training and
encouragement? That the average Negro laborer today is less efficient
than the average European laborer is certain. When, however, you take
into account the Negro’s past industrial training, his present
ignorance, and the social atmosphere in which he works it is not exactly
fair to condemn him nor is it easy to say offhand what is his possible
worth. Certainly increasing intelligence has made him increasingly
discontented with his conditions of work; the determined withdrawing of
responsibility from the Negro has not increased his sense of
responsibility; the systematic exploitation of black labor has decreased
its steadiness and reliability. Notwithstanding all this there never
were before in the world’s history so many black men steadily engaged in
common and skilled labor as in the case of the American Negro. Nor is
there today a laboring force which seems capable, under judicious
guidance, of more remarkable development.</p>
<h2 id="economic-groups">Economic Groups</h2>
<p>The Negroes of America may be divided into three distinct economic
groups:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The independents—farmers, teachers, clergymen, merchants and
professional men and women.</li>
<li>The struggling—artisans, industrial helpers, servants and farm
tenants.</li>
<li>The common laborers.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-independents"><span class="pagenum">131</span>The
Independents</h3>
<p>The independents number possibly 300,000 Negroes and include 225,000
farmers, 25,000 teachers, 17,000 clergymen, 15,000 merchants and numbers
of professional men and women of various sorts. They are separated
sharply into a rural group of farmers and an urban group and are
characterized by the fact that with few exceptions they live by an
economic service done their own people. This is least true in regard to
the farmers but even in their case it is approximately true, for they,
to an increasingly large degree, raise their own supplies and use their
produce as a surplus crop. Usually thru this alone do they come into
national economy. This group is the one that feels the force of outward
competition and prejudice least in its economic life and most in its
spiritual life. It is the head and front of the group economy movement,
comprehends the spiritual as well as the economic leaders and is bound
in the future to have a large and important development, limited only by
the ability of the race to support it. However, in some respects this
group is truly vulnerable. Many of the teachers, for instance, depend
upon educational boards elected by white voters and many depend upon
philanthropy. There has been concerted action in some of the rural
districts of the South to drive out the best Negro teachers and even in
the cities the way of the independent black teacher who dares think his
own thots is made difficult. In many cases Negro teachers under the
great philanthropic foundations are being continually warned that their
bread and butter depend on their agreeing with present public opinion in
regard to the Negro. There is growing up however, silently, almost
unnoticed, a distinct Negro private school system officered, taught,
attended and supported by Negroes. Such private schools have today at
least 30,000 pupils and are growing rapidly—another example of group
economy as produced by the Negro American.</p>
<p>If we regard exclusively the urban group of these independents we
find that the best class of this group is fully abreast in education and
morality with the great middle class <span class="pagenum">132</span>of
Americans. They have furnisht notable names in literature, business and
professional life and have repeatedly in Boston, New York, Philadelphia,
Chicago, Washington and other great urban centers proved their right to
be treated as American citizens on a plane of perfect equality with
other citizens. Despite this fact and despite the fact, too, that this
group is numerically small and without much inherited wealth, it has
been struggling under two overwhelming burdens: First, upon this group
has been laid the duty and responsibility of the care, guidance and
reformation of the great stream of black rural immigrants from the South
simply because they happen to be of the same race. There is no claim or
vestige of a claim that this small city group of risen Negroes is
responsible for the degradation of the plantation, yet upon this small
group the great work is placed. In the case of other immigrants to our
urban centers, each race must care for its own and be responsible for
its advancement, but the helpers are given all aid and sympathy in their
undertakings and their hands are upheld. In the case of the Negro
however, every disability, every legal, social and economic bar placed
before the new immigrant must be endured by the city group on whom the
immigrants have been dumped. And that group must be judged continually
by the worst class of those very immigrants whose uplift is calmly
shifted by the city at large.</p>
<p>What is the result? The talented tenth is submerged under the wave of
immigration. And this is the second burden under which the group has
labored. This has been the experience in many cities of the North. In
the South, however, the beating back of the leading group has not
awaited the excuse of immigration. On the general ground of impudence or
indolence members of this class of economic and social leaders have been
repeatedly driven out of the smaller towns, while in the larger cities
every possible combination and tool from the Jim Crow laws to the secret
society and the boycott has been made time and time again to curtail the
economic advantages of the members of this class and to <span
class="pagenum">133</span>make their daily life so intolerable that they
would either leave or sink to listless acquiescence.</p>
<p>What then, in view of these conditions, can this town group do in
self defence? It can organize the Negroes about it into a self supplying
group. This organization is actually going on. So far has it gone that
in cities like Washington, Richmond and Atlanta a Negro family which
does not employ a Negro physician is in danger of social ostracism; in
the North this is extending to grocery stores and similar businesses.
Whereas only a few years ago Negroes transacted insurance business with
white companies, today more than half of that business has passed to
black companies.</p>
<p>There are persons who see nothing but the advantages of this course.
But it has grave disadvantages, too. It intensifies prejudice and
bitterness. For example: White insurance agents and collectors in the
South, for fear of white opinion, would not take off their hats when
they entered Negro homes. The black companies have harpt on this,
publisht it, called attention to it and actually capitalized it into
cold cash. Again, this movement narrows the activity of the best class
of Negroes, withdraws them from much helpful competition and contact,
perverts and cheapens their ideals—in fact provincializes them in thot
and deed. Yet it is today the only path of economic escape for the most
gifted class of black men and the development along this line is certain
to be enormous.</p>
<p>Turning to the rural group of this independent class the Negro land
owners are to be considered. Here first one runs against one of those
traditional statements which pass for truth because unchallenged,
namely, that it is easy for the southern Negro to buy land. The letter
of this statement is true but the spirit of it is false. There are vast
tracts of land in the South that anybody, black or white, can buy for
little or nothing for the simple reason that such tracts are worth
little or nothing. Eventually these lands will become valuable. But they
are almost valueless today. For the Negro, land to be of any value must
have present value for he is too poor to wait. Moreover it must be:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">134</span></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Land which he knows how to cultivate.</li>
<li>Land accessible to a market.</li>
<li>Land so situated as to afford the owner protection.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are certain crops which the Negro farmer knows how to
cultivate; to these can be added certain food supplies. Gradually
intensive cultivation can be taught but this takes a long time. It is
idle to compare the South with Belgium or France for the agricultural
economy of those lands is the result of centuries of training aided by a
rising market and by law and order, while the present agricultural
economy of the South is but a generation removed from the land murder of
a slave regime. No graduate of that school knows how to make the desert
blossom as the rose and the process of teaching must be long and
tedious. Meantime he must live on such crops as he knows how to
cultivate. In addition to the poverty of the soil, bad roads,
comparatively few railroads and few navigable rivers throw much of this
land out of usefulness. But even more important than all this: the Negro
farmer must seek the protection of community life with his own people
and this he finds in the black belt. It is precisely in this black belt,
however, that it is most difficult for him to buy land. For there it is
that the capitalistic culture of cotton with a system of labor peonage
is so profitable that land is high. In addition, in many of these
regions it is considered bad policy to sell land to Negroes because a
fever of land owning “demoralizes” the labor system; so that in the
densest black belt of the South the percentage of land holding among
Negroes is alarmingly low, a fact that has led to curious moralizing on
the shiftlessness of black men.</p>
<p>The increase of the average size of farms in many parts * of the
South is illustrative of the astounding and dangerous concentration of
land holding in that section which is itself more appalling when it is
noted that many of these farms do not belong singly to single owners but
are owned in groups of as high as forty or fifty by great landed
proprietors. Many of these landed proprietors refuse to sell a single
acre of land to black men. While there are of course large regions where
black men can buy land on reasonable terms, it is <span
class="pagenum">135</span>usually land poorly situated as regards
markets, or unhealth-ful in climate, or so placed as to afford the
owners poor schools and lawless, overbearing white neighbors.</p>
<p>Add to these facts the results of the training and the character of
the Negro farmers. Black farmers are often discust and criticised as tho
they were responsible, trained men who carelessly and viciously neglect
their economic opportunity. On the contrary they are for the most part
unlettered men, consciously and carefully trained to irresponsibility,
to whom all concepts of modern property and saving are new and who need
benevolent guardianship in their upward striving. Such guardianship they
have in some cases received from former masters and in this way a
considerable number of the present land owners first got their land. In
the great majority of cases however, this guardianship has consisted in
deliberately taking the earnings of the Negro farmer and appropriating
them to the use of the landlord. The argument was this: “These Negroes
do not need this money. If I give it to them theyTl squander it or leave
the plantation; therefore I will give them just enough to be happy and
keep them with me. In any case their* labor rightfully belongs to me and
my fathers and was illegally taken from us.” On the strength of this
argument and by such practices it is a conservative estimate to say that
three-fourths of the stipulated wages and shares of crops which the
Negro has earned on the farm since emancipation has been illegally
withheld from him by the white landlords, either on the plea that this
was for his own good or without any plea at all.</p>
<p>Would this wealth have been wasted if given the laborer? Waiving the
mere question of the right of any employer to withhold wages, take the
purely economic question: Is the community richer by such practices? It
is not. The South is poorer. The best Negroes would have squandered much
at first and most would have squandered all, but this would have been
more than offset by the increased responsibility and efficiency of the
resulting Negro landholders. Nor is <span class="pagenum">136</span>this
mere pious opinion. There is in the South in the middle of the black
belt, a county of some 700 square miles, Lowndes County, Alabama. It
contained in 1910 28,125 Negroes and 3,769 whites. It was formerly the
seat of the most strenuous type of American slavery—with absentee
owners, living at ease in Montgomery, great stretches of plantations
with 500 to 1000 slaves on each driven by overseers and riders. There
was no communication with the outside world, little passing between
plantations. The Negroes were slothful and ignorant—even today, fifty
years after emancipation, the illiteracy among those over ten is about
51 per cent. It would be difficult to find a place where conditions were
on the whole more unfavorable to the rise of the Negro. The white
element was lawless, the Negroes thoroly cowed, and up until recent
times the body of a dead Negro did not even call for an arrest. In this
county during the last twenty years there has been carried on a scheme
of co-operative land buying under the Calhoun School. It was asked for
by a few Negroes who could not get land; it was engineered by a Negro
graduate of Hampton; it was made,possible by the willingness of a white
landlord to sell his plantation and actively further the enterprise by
advice and good will. It was capitalized by white northerners and
inspired by a New England woman. Here was every element in partnership
and the experiment began in 1892. It encountered all sorts of
difficulties: the character and training of the men involved; the enmity
of the surrounding white population with a few notable exceptions; the
natural suspicion of the black population born of a regime of cheating;
the low price of cotton; several years of alternate flood and drouth;
and the attempts of the neighboring whites to secure the homesteads thru
mortgages.</p>
<p>The twentieth annual report of the Principal of the Calhoun Colored
School of Calhoun, Lowndes County, Alabama, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While in 1892 the majority of the people lived in rented one-room
cabins, now by far the larger number are in cottages of from two to four
<span class="pagenum">137</span>rooms and in some cases as many as six
to eight rooms. Many of these cottages were put up and are owned by the
Negro occupants on land they have hot thru the school.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The improvements have come slowly and by daily almost imperceptible
growth, but just as truly have they come to stay and to increase. … All
the land the school had for sale near its own locality has been bot by
the Negroes. Several men have this year finisht their payments on land
and on houses, and have paid in full the mortgages they were under. Only
a few men have still a debt remaining before they can really say, “These
are our own homes.” In several instances a man has sold a few acres of
his land to lessen the debt upon the whole, and this is a double help.
It reduces his financial burden and forces him into more intensive
farming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only from an economic point of view but from the standpoint of
the sociologist as well the experiment here in Lowndes County has been
both interesting and successful. The Negroes call it the “Free Land.”
There are no overseers and riders roaming about whipping the workers and
seducing black wives and daughters; there is an eight months’ school in
their midst, a pretty new church, monthly conferences, a peculiar system
of self government, and a family life of high moral tone.</p>
<p>What has been done in Lowndes County under the Calhoun School and the
sensible guardianship of its wise leaders could be duplicated in every
single black belt county in the South. It is to be hoped that such will
be done and on that hope is based one’s faith in the economic future of
this black rural group.</p>
<h3 id="the-struggling">The Struggling</h3>
<p>The second great economic group among the Negroes of America may be
called “the struggling.” It includes the artisans, the industrial
helpers, the servants and the farm tenants. This group is characterized
as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It is sharply divided into a city and a country group.</li>
<li>While it has a large significance in the group economy of the Negro
American, its overwhelming significance is for the industry of the
nation as a whole.</li>
<li>Its great hindrance is the necessity of group substitution in the
place of individual promotion.</li>
<li>Its greatest enemy is the organized opposition of its white fellow
workmen.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="pagenum">138</span>The rural group of this class of
Negro Americans consists of farm tenants. In a large number of cases
farm tenancy has been an aid to land buying; in many cases farm tenancy
has been a school of thrift and saving; in the majority of cases it was
the only available system after the war when the Negroes were set free
without landed possessions of their own. Yet, when all this is said, it
remains true that the system of farm tenancy as practiced over the
larger part of the South today is a direct encouragement to cheating and
peonage, a means of debauching labor, and a feeder of crime and
vagrancy. It demands for its support a system of mortgage and contract
laws and a method of administration which are a disgrace to twentieth
century civilization. For every man whom the system has helped into
independence it has pushed ten back into virtual slavery. It is often
claimed that honest and benevolent employers and landholders have made
this system a means of uplift, development and growth. In thousands of
cases this is perfectly true; but at the same time it remains true and
terribly true that any system of free labor where the returns of the
laborer, the settlement of all disputes, the drawing of the contract,
the determination of the rent, the expenditure of the employees or
tenants, the price they pay for living, the character of the houses they
live in, and their movements during and after their work are left
practically to the unquestionable power of one man who owns the land and
profits by the labor and who is in the exercise of his power practically
unrestrained by public opinion or the courts and who has no fear of
ballots in the hands of the laborers or their friends—any such system is
inherently wrong. If men complain of its results being shiftlessness,
listlessness and crime, they have themselves to thank. To the man who
declares that he is acting justly and treating his tenants and employees
even better than they treat themselves, it is sufficient answer to say
that he is an exception to the rule; that the majority of the
landholders are as indifferent to the welfare of their men as are
employers the world over; and that a deplorably large minority
consciously oppress and cheat <span class="pagenum">139</span>them. The
best employer or landholder suffers therefore for the sins of the
average.</p>
<p>The only salvation for these Negro tenants lies in land-holding, and
in this the Negroes have made commendable strides. In 1890 Negro
Americans owned 120,738 farms; in 1900 they owned 187,799 farms; in 1910
they owned about 220,000 farms, an increase of over 82 per cent. If the
Negroes thruout the whole of the rural South had been encouraged by such
wise economic leadership as was the case in Lowndes County, Alabama,
referred to above, the record would be even more encouraging.</p>
<p>The city group of this class of Negro workers consists of perhaps
130,000 skilled artisans, 600,000 semi-skilled and ordinary industrial
helpers, and 500,000 servants. The servant class has lost most of its
best representatives because it offers a narrower and narrower method of
uplift. This is due in part to foreign competition and in part to the
fact that the temptations to Negro girls in domestic service are greater
than in any single industry. It must be remembered that the mulatto is
the product of house service in the South.</p>
<p>With the skilled and semi-skilled Negroes the industrial history has
been this: Groups of Negroes have been excluded entirely from certain
trades and admitted to others. Unfortunately they have been able to hold
their place in the second set by working for lower wages, tho in certain
industries they have forced themselves without resorting to the lever of
low wages. This gave the trade unions a chance to fight Negroes as
scabs. In some battles the unions won and so continued to exclude
Negroes. In other cases the Negroes won and were admitted to the unions.
Even in the union, however, they have been and are today discriminated
against in many cases. In the near future the members of this class of
Negro workingmen are going to have the struggle of their lives and the
outlook indicates that by the fulcrum of low wages and the group
economy, coupled with increasing efficiency, they will win. This means
that the Negro is to be admitted to the national economy only by
degrading labor conditions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">140</span>The alternative offered is shameful
and could be easily avoided if color prejudice did not insist upon group
substitution for Negroes in industry. That is, under present conditions
a single individual or a few men of Negro descent cannot usually gain
admittance to an industry. Only when they can produce workmen enough to
supply the whole industry or the particular enterprise can the black man
be admitted. Then immediately this substitution is made the occasion of
a change in labor conditions—lower wages, longer hours and worse
treatment. It thus often happens that by refusing to work beside a
single black man, the workmen in an industry suffer a general lowering
of wages and working conditions. The real economic question in the South
is: How long will race prejudice supply a more powerful motive to white
workingmen of the South than decent wages and industrial conditions?
Today the powerful threat of Negro labor is making child labor and the
fourteen-hour day possible in southern factories. How long will it be
before the white workingmen of the South discover that the interests
that bind them to their black brothers are greater than those that
artificially separate them? The answer is easy: That discovery will not
be made until the present wave of extraordinary prosperity and
exploitation passes and the ordinary every day level of economic
struggle begins. If the Negro can hold his own until then his
development is certain.</p>
<h3 id="the-common-laborers">The Common Laborers</h3>
<p>The third distinct economic group of American Negroes is the group of
common laborers numbering more than two millions. A million and a
quarter are farm laborers and the remainder are common laborers of other
sorts. This group includes half the breadwinners of the race and its
condition is precarious. In many of the country districts of the South
the laws concerning contracts, wages and vagrancy are continually
forcing the lower half of these laborers into pauperism and crime. In
most of the southern states the law concerning the breaking of a
contract to work made between an ignorant farm hand and a land owner and
covering a year’s <span class="pagenum">141</span>time is enforced to
the letter and the breaking of such a contract by the laborer is a
penitentiary offense. A large proportion of the homicides in the country
districts of the South in which Negroes are the slayers or the victims
arise from disputes over wage settlement. So intolerable has the
condition of the farm laborer of the South become, that he is running
away from the country and entering the cities, there to add to the
already complex problems of city life. One frequently hears the demand
for immigrants to fill the places of these fleeing Negro farm hands.
Notwithstanding all efforts in this direction it is safe to say that no
group of immigrants will stand the present contract and crop lien
system. Certain it is that they will not stand the lawlessness of the
average country district of the South where every white man is a law
unto himself and where no Negro has any rights which the worst white man
is bound to respect. So bad has this lawlessness become in some parts of
the South that concerted and commendable action has been taken against
white cappers and night riders and a few peonage cases have reached the
courts. These efforts, however, have but scratched the surface of the
real trouble—a trouble which lies deep-seated in the social fabric of
the South, a trouble which so seriously retards the whole South in its
economic advancement and development.</p>
<p>On the whole there are four general cures for the economic submersion
of this class of Negro Americans. First, the classes above must be given
every facility to rise so as not to bear down upon them from above.
Secondly, the system of law and law courts in the South by which it is
practically impossible in the country districts and improbable even in
the cities for a black laborer to force justice from a white employer
must be changed. Thirdly, Negro children must be given common school
training. The states are not doing their duty in this respect and the
tendency in some of them is to do less.<a href="#fn2"

<p><span class="pagenum">142</span>Finally, the black laborer must have
a vote. It is impossible for these two million and more black workingmen
to maintain themselves when thrust into modern competitive industry so
long as the state allows them no voice or influence in the making of the
laws or the interpretation and administration of the same.</p>
<p>The value of land and buildings owned by Negroes in the South in 1910
was $272,992,238, an increase of nearly 90 per cent in a single decade.
This does not include land owned by Negro farmers and rented out. On a
basis of the value of farm property the total Negro wealth today may be
estimated at $570,000,000. Yet in much of the South the holders of this
wealth are as absolutely disfranchised as the worst criminal in the
penitentiary. They cannot say a word as to the condition of the roads
and highways which pass their property, or as to the location or
supervision of their schools or the choice of teachers, or as to the
selection of the government officials or the fixing of the rate of
taxation.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Half the Negro breadwinners of the nation are partially submerged by
a bad economic system, an unjust administration of the laws, and
enforced ignorance. Their future depends on common schools, justice, and
the right to vote. A million and three-quarters of men just above these
are fighting a fierce battle for admission to the industrial ranks of
the nation—for the right to work. They are handicapped by their own
industrial history which has made them often shiftless and
untrustworthy; but they can, by means of wise economic leadership, be
made a strong body of artisans and land owners. Three hundred thousand
men stand economically at the head of the Negroes, and by a peculiar
self protecting group economy are making themselves independent of
prejudice and competition.</p>
<p>What can be said of any one of these groups of black working men can
be said of them all. <em>In so far as they are given opportunity and
assured justice, in so far can the world expect from them the maximum of
efficiency and service.</em></p>
