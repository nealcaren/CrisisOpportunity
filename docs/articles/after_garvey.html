<p>A man who in five years could attach to himself the confidence and
loyalty of four million persons, however gullible they might be, who
could make his views, even tho absurd, the keystone of a philosophy
worthy of elevation to the dignity of a “wing of Negro thot,” who could
call an international convention and actually get delegates from over
forty foreign countries, however futile their deliberations might have
been, who could lead a German society to send a petition to him to use
his influence against the use of black troops on the Rhine, whether he
could do anything about it or not—such a man can scarcely be treated as
a joke. Marcus Garvey, picturesquely labeled by himself the “Provisional
President of Africa,” and by others, variously, as the “Black Moses,”
the “Emperor Jones of Finance,” the “Savior of the Black Race,” “Black
Ponzi,” the “West Indian Wallingford,” and in more intimate persiflage
as “liar,” “martyr,” “dreamer,” and “thief,” has been halted in a most
spectacular career by the government of the United States.</p>
<p>He was convicted on one count of six named in the indictment for
using the mails to defraud, while—others indicted with him were
released. He was given the limit of the law— five years imprisonment and
a fine of One Thousand Dollars.</p>
<p>Pending trial he was at liberty on $2,500 bail. After conviction he
was denied bail at any figure. All this is most significant. Obvi<span
class="pagenum">232</span>ously his financial exploits were ridiculously
unsound, his plans for the redemption of Africa absurdedly visionary and
impossible, his methods injudicious and bunglesome, and the grand
result, a fleecing of hundreds of thousands of poor and ignorant
Negroes.</p>
<p>Yet not one of those who saw their earnings swallowed up in this
gigantic swindle raised a single effective protest. The spectators who
crowded the courts were sympathizers with the accused. Ten days after
his conviction a petition of 20,000 names was on its way to the White
House, a Garvey Defense Fund created, and the articulate public split
between sympathy and condemnation. It is a situation interesting in its
contradictions and scarcely intelligible to one who does not, at the
same time, reflect that the American psychology—the psychology of the
white world—is itself a mixture of contradictions and paradoxes.</p>
<h2 id="ii">II</h2>
<p>Garvey is a symbol—a symptom. The “Garvey Movement” is just another
name for the new psychology of the American Negro peasantry—for the
surge of race consciousness felt by Negroes thruout the world, the
intelligent as well as the ignorant. It is a black version of that same
100 per cent mania that now afflicts white America, that emboldens the
prophets of a “Nordic blood renaissance,” that picked up and carried the
cry of “self-determination for all people,” “India for the Indians,” “A
Free Ireland.” The personal characteristics that make him obnoxious to
his critics are precisely those that made him a strong leader. His
extravagant self-esteem could have been taken for dignity, his
hard-headedness as self-reliance. his ignorance of law as transcendency,
his blunders as persecution, his stupidity as silent deliberation, his
churlishness and irascibility as the eccentricity of genius.</p>
<p>The English in the West Indies have a rather effective way of
breaking the prestige of the native Obia man. A part of his punishment
is a public lashing. Five years in prison may do the same for Garvey
himself. But the movement, aside from Garvey, will scarcely be affected.
It is like trying to cure a disease by magic, or perhaps more pointedly,
like trying to change the direction of primitive religious energy by
confiscating the fetich.</p>
<p>Judge Mack was in a situation. Obviously there were evidences of even
greater guilt than could be established by witnesses. The specific count
on which he was convicted was that of selling stock in the Black Star
Line after it had become and was known to him to be insolvent. Actually
about $800,000 has been squandered on ancient vessels, two of which
dropped to pieces from old age and the third was seized in Cuba for
claims. There was a Negro Factories Corporation capitalized at
$1,000,000 whose material goods consisted of a few rather negligible
grocery stores in Harlem. The gigantic phantom of a Universal Negro
Improvement Association, stretching a protective arm around the
400.000,000 dark peoples of the world was floated by the dues,
assessments and contributions of hundreds of thousands of
Negroes—vainly? To have succeeded would have been as great a catastrophe
to the interest of the white world as failure could have been to the
Negroes.</p>
<p>But against this testy element there was at stake unquestionably the
hopes and aspirations of a million Negroes. They may have been fleeced,
but they were not resentful—nor even shaken in their loyalty.</p>
<p>It is this phase of psychology that is most interesting—that
outshadows the personal traits and vicissitudes of Marcus Garvey. For
the “Back to Africa Movement,” tho visionary and perhaps utterly
impossible of accomplishment, afforded a mental relaxation for the long
submerged Negro peasantry. It was a dream—but the new psychology has
taught us the utility, the compensatory value, of dreams. These might be
expected to increase in intensity in direct proportion to the
impossibility of conscious realization. Assuming, as we now must, the
increased desires and aspirations of Negroes and the correspondingly
increased racial consciousness among white groups, what other mode of
escape is possible? Balked desires, repressed longings, must have an
outlet. This was an outlet.</p>
<h2 id="ill">Ill</h2>
<p>Essentially this is a movement of pure blood Negroes. It is their
revanche. Mixed bloods—mulattoes—have received a shade more
consideration at the hands of white America. This is partly a question
of kinship, partly the caprice of scientific theory, partly physical
similarity, partly traditional advantage in wage opportunities.</p>
<p>The full blood Negroes are at more serious disadvantage against the
culture of this country, with its standard of beauty based on angularity
and absence of color. They are the children of the soil—the descendants
of plantation hands, without voice, without leadership, and with little
basis for self pride.</p>
<p>Bad as it is in the United States, it is worst in the West Indies.
There the relatively small number of whites has made it necessary to
create a distinct middle-color class—the mulattoes, those whose white
blood exceeds the black. This hierarchy amounts almost to caste,—the
whites superior to the mulattoes but in association with them; the
mulattoes superior to the blacks and aggressively so; the blacks at the
bottom,—smoldering, resentful.</p>
<p>Out of this last class came Garvey, hating intensely things white and
more intensely things near white.</p>
<p>The first considerable project in this country was the Black Star
Line—a purely commercial proposition. In it he wanted no white capital.
He distrusted it. But Negro capital was scattered, uninterested, and
small. It was necessary to build up a sentiment to attract it. This is
his monumental contribution. With an intensified background, the product
of his upbringing in the West Indies, his blows were aimed at the gaping
strictures in the American Negro’s status. Negro domination? This<span
class="pagenum">233</span> nightmare of southern whites and the excuse
for denying the merest political privileges to Negroes was skirted by
picturing a land where Negroes could rule themselves. Social equality?
Yes, but not in the sense offensive to whites who feared inter-marriage.
It would be nation with nation. In September 1921 he said in a letter to
the *Tribune:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Universal Negro Improvement Association, which I represent, seeks
to prove to the world our ability as a race politically, socially,
industrially, and religiously, and after this accomplishment we feel
sure all races will be willing to accept us on an equal footing.
Dr. DuBois, to the contrary, seeks to have the white race admit Negroes
to the full enjoyment of all the privileges produced by the white race
without any exertion or effort on the part of the Negro to do for
himself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Addressing his international congress in August 1921, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are willing to form an alliance with the white people, only we
say, “What is good for you is good for me.” Hand in hand the colored
race and the white can accomplish much that is desirable, but there must
be equality or the Negro will not join with his ancient master.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or, again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I can interpret correctly the spirit of the Negro, it is for me to
say that Negroes everywhere are determined to be free—determined to be
liberated—liberated from mob rule, liberated from segregation, liberated
from Jimcrowism, liberated from injustices of all kinds. Let the world
understand that 400,000,000 Negroes are determined to die for their
liberty and that if we must die, we shall die nobly, we shall die
gallantly, fighting up the battle heights of Africa to plant there the
standard which represents liberty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fellow men of the world, let us realize that it is now or never. This
is our last chance for permanent organization; this is our last chance
for saving ourselves, industrially and politically. Let no power on
earth turn you against yourselves. Remember, we are living in an age of
the survival of the fittest; the fittest in race and the fittest in
government. Remember, that the various statesmen of the various
governments of the world are pitted against each other in the great
battle of intellect, where the one hopes to defeat the other only
through his intellectual superiority and his greater foresight. The
Negro cannot afford to sleep intellectually, the Negro cannot afford to
ignore the signs of the times. It is for him now to awaken himself from
his long slumber, the slumber of Rip Van Winkle, and see that it is time
for him to be on his guard, and to keep in action in his own
defence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The side-show of Africa for Africans thus devoured the circus of a
steamship line plying between this country and Africa. The innumerable
branches of the Universal Negro Improvement Association, in which these
submerged Negroes got their first taste of authority and importance,
were like so many little principalities. The shower of grandiose titles
and ceremonial costumes gave added prestige. Supported by the naturally
aggressive enthusiasm of West Indian compatriots and by a well paid
staff of propagandists and writers, the American Negro peasantry was
aroused to the point that “Garvey himself,” as one enthusiast remarked,
“could not stop the movement.”</p>
<p>Around this developed a race philosophy original only in the sense
that it was an inversion of white standards—a typical revolt. God is to
be thot of as black; instead of Red Cross nurses, there are black cross
nurses; the White Star Line becomes the Black Star Line. As the movement
grew, other convenient arrangements were taken over. Just prior to the
first international convention, DeValera was elected Provisional
President of Ireland. Garvey then became Provisional President of
Africa. There were Supreme Highnesses, Presidents General, Knight
Commanders of the Order of the Nile, of the Distinguished Service Order
of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>One of the great deficiencies of Negroes in America is the absence of
any well established historical background of which they can be proud.
This distinguishes them in their own esteem from the humblest Pole, for
example. An emphasis then is placed by the Negroes of the movement upon
early African civilization. Some of the banners in a recent parade in
New York carried these inscriptions: “Africa, Mother of Civilization,”
“Princes Shall Come Out Of Egypt.” These were associated, at least in
thot, with the hopes and dreams, some fantastic, some desperate, some
mystical, which have inspired the movement from the beginning: “’Free
Africa,” “By the Science of Perpetual Motion, the Negro Will Conquer,”
“The Negro Will Build Cruisers and Submarines,” “African Scientists Will
Win The War,” “The New Negro Is Ready For the Ku Klux.”</p>
<p>There has been more criticism of Garvey than of the movement. This is
misleading. Everybody knows that the roots of the unrest so manifest in
the behavior of these Negroes are utterly unaffected by the clamor for
the leader’s head. It is perhaps good that he has been put away.
Certainly there will be less exploitation of the character described in
the charges against him. But it must also be remembered that this
restlessness will express itself in some way. Dreaming was, to say the
least, a harmless substitute for adventure and the satisfaction of long
cherished but repressed desires, altho the cost of such a pasttime
seemed an intolerable waste to practical men of affairs. The sources of
this discontent must be remedied effectively and now, or this
accumulating energy and unrest, blocked off from its dreams, will take
another direction. Perhaps this also will be harmless. But who
knows?</p>
