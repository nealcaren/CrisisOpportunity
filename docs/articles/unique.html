<p><span class="pagenum">165</span>Sociology began as a general science
of society for the discovery and definition of the laws controlling the
evolution of human groups and, after passing through a period
distinguished by controversies about its point of view, has entered a
period of research and investigation.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Although as late as
January of the present year. Professor Flonan Znaniecki, in the
*American Journal of Sociology,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> could complain of a
“complete chaos of methodological presuppositions manifested in general
works of sociology,” and believes that, “No other science shows a
similar multiplicity of disconnected viewpoints,” sociology has settled
upon a unit for investigation; namely, the social group. A sociological
group may be defined as “a number of people interacting or reciprocally
influencing one another, thereby producing definite relationships among
one another.”<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Among the groups which are subject
to the sociological discipline the family holds a place of primary
importance.</p>
<p>In order to answer the question of the uniqueness of the Negro
family, it would be necessary to study its structure and the
organization of attitudes within this group, with the view of finding
out if these attitudes, which are of greater sociological importance
than its structure, are the same as those in the white American family.
Although the writer is not prepared to give any final answer based upon
extensive research to this question, he will attempt to discuss those
factors in the situation which have affected the organization of the
Negro family. Before entering upon this discussion, some facts
concerning the relation between culture and race should be emphasized in
order that the popular fallacies concerning this relation might not
prevent a clear understanding of the viewpoint of this paper.</p>
<h2 id="i">I</h2>
<p>The intrusion of facts which might seem to be long more properly to
academic discussions is not only justified by the nature of the subject,
but by the fact that much administrative procedure and social policy are
governed by dogmatic conceptions concerning the influence of race on
culture. The wide currency given the preposterous theory that western
culture represents the efflorescence of a single racial stock has helped
to strengthen these false conceptions. Because sociologists and
anthropologists have recognized the erroneous ideas that are consciously
and unconsciously associated with the term “primitive” in referring to
peoples possessing a simple culture, they have substituted the term
“preliterate”, which is more nearly descriptive of their relation to
peoples on a higher plane of culture.</p>
<p>The first fact which we would emphasize is that I there have been no
important organic changes in the human race during the historic period.
It is necessary to emphasize this fact, because most people who think in
terms of evolutionary changes hold the opinion that the culture of a
people represents their biological development. In this same connection
it should also be made clear that there is no* basis for the rather
general erroneous belief that social evolution follows a definite
course, each stage growing naturally out of the preceding stage because
of some inherent principle. This second point needs emphasis because
many people in discussions concerning the Negro’s acquiring western
civilization express the opinion that we must wait on the process of
social evolution. Authorities generally agree that all races have the
capacity for acquiring western civilization; although some are in doubt
as to whether all races are equally capable of enriching it. This is
true not only of the material aspects of culture but also of the
institutional forms. There has been much dogmatizing about the
psychological unfitness of certain races for the institutional forms of
western culture. There is no evidence to support a belief in fundamental
psychological differences between races. The discredited “instinct
psychology” which had much vogue recently was often called upon to
support the belief that the sex instinct in the Negro broke through
institutionalized sex controls. Culture is acquired in the social
environment, and the Negro has taken on the habits of culture according
to the environment stimulation to which he has been exposed. Therefore,
any study of the Negro family which possesses value must study it
historically and apply the method of cultural analysis.</p>
<h2 id="ii">II</h2>
<p>While the Negro lived under institutionalized sex and family
relations in Africa, which represented a cultural adaptation, the
African sex mores were thoroughly disorganized under the institution of
slavery. Although it has been claimed that traces of the African
tradition were detected in marriage ceremonies as late as near the
opening of the present century,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> the history of the
American family group begins with the introduction of the Negro in
America. The Negro family during slavery was modelled to some extent
after the monogamous ideal of the whites. This was true chiefly in the
case of the house servants. The slaves on the plantations lived in the
demoralized condition that naturally followed the destruction of the
African tribal and family controls and the exigencies of the status of
chattel property. Even in the case of the house servants the monogamous
ideal was often violated by the masters who were the only models for
setting up a new ideal of family life.</p>
<p>Since emancipation the family has tended towards the monogamous
ideal. The process has been slow or rapid as one takes into
consideration the different forces which have influenced the integration
of this primary social group. Here the method of cultural analysis,
which takes into account all the fac<span
class="pagenum">166</span>tors, psychological, social and economic,
which determine the character of any group, is the only approach to an
understanding of the Negro family during slavery and since emancipation.
It is the opinion of the writer that this approach to the Negro family
would not show it to be unique; that is, based upon attitudes wholly
different from the white American family. In other words, it would not
present the unique characteristics which a family group like the
Chinese, where the family is based upon blood, land, law and religion,
and is the “practical unit of social control in the village,” <a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> would present if placed in the
American social environment. The unique characteristics of the Negro
family are due to the break in cultural continuity and the economic and
social forces which have affected its integration in the American
environment. These forces, it seems, are of sufficient weight to make
the Negro family the subject for special study as a sociological
unit.</p>
<h2 id="iii">III</h2>
<p>The first fact that makes the Negro family the subject of special
sociological study is the incomplete assimilation of western culture by
the Negro masses. Generally when two different cultures come into
contact, each modifies the other. But in the case of the Negro in
America it meant the total destruction of the African social heritage.
Therefore in the case of the family group the Negro has not introduced
new patterns of behavior; but has failed to conform to the patterns
about him. The degree of conformity is determined by educational and
economic factors as well as by social isolation. In the rural sections
where the isolation is greatest, it is not uniformly true that he fails
to live up to the monogamous ideal about him; for the primary controls
of the country often maintain the solidarity of the family which is lost
in the anonymity of city life. These are, of course, questions which can
only be answered by research.</p>
<p>The second factor that influences the character of the Negro family
is his economic and social position in American life. According to the
1920 census, 22.1 per cent of all Negroes over ten years of age
gainfully employed were in domestic and personal services, and 45.2 per
cent in agriculture. Elsewhere the writer has spoken of the influence of
personal services on the family life of the Negro. There are many
aspects of the plantation system of the South which have affected the
integrity of the Negro family. These have never been the subject of
extensive sociological study. Another aspect of race relations which has
had important bearing on our question is the intermixture of the two
races. This influences the family life by causing the segregation and
inbreeding of mulatto communities; the creation of an added burden of
illegitimacy and concubinage; and the break in family life by the
crossing over into the white race of the light members of the
family.</p>
<p>In the Negro family we have two forces at work; those causing its
integration, and those tending to disintegrate it. The integrating
forces are the social pressures which through education and the
assimilation of American civilization are overcoming the disorganization
of the past. At the same time the family is subject to the same forces
which are destroying the semi-patriarchal family in America. These
forces probably are not as extensive in their operation as among the
whites; but they are operative.</p>
<p>Aside from these purely social factors there are certain biological
aspects of the family which could well be studied. Although it is
probably true that there has been no change in the biological make-up of
African races during the historical period, there is ground for the
opinion that the African environment favored the selection of certain
racial traits. Many grotesque and dogmatic conjectures have been made on
the basis of this assumption. Fecundity of Negro families and age of
marriage have been influenced by the same factors as among the whites.
Investigation over a large area alone can settle these problems.</p>
<p>In summing up his position on this question, the writer would say
that while the Negro family is not unique in being based upon attitudes
foreign to the American family; but because of the influences given
above it requires special study as a sociological unit.</p>
