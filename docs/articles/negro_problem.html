<p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract: </strong>Being extracts from two
lectures on “The Sociological Point Of View In The Study Of Race
Problems,” and “The Negro Problem; What It Is Not, And What It Is”</p>



<h2 id="foreward">Foreward</h2>
<p>The following papers were prepared for the Social Study Class at the
University of Pennsylvania, and partly published by the <em>Public
Ledger,</em> of Philadelphia, and a number of other publications. The
first part tells of the attitude which social students ought to have in
the study of race problems, and the difficulties involved; the second
portion is an analysis of the Negro problem, which, when first
published, attracted considerable attention. This is presented in this
form chiefly for the criticism of the reader; and no one will welcome
this criticism any more than the author.</p>
<p>November, 1911.</p>
<h2 id="the-sociological-attitude-in-the-study-of-negro-problems">The
Sociological Attitude in the Study of Negro Problems</h2>
<p>I have been asked to speak on the Negro Problem. What, may I ask,
should be the proper attitude of the social student toward this
so-called Negro Problem? Before we go into any analysis of the same, it
is necessary that we should carefully consider some of the fundamental
principles of the science of sociology as it bears upon our study of
race.</p>
<h3 id="fundamental-principles">Fundamental Principles</h3>
<p>Sociology is the last of the great sciences. It is only a little more
than a generation old, and, as yet, its principles are not quite
definite. So that among any large number of people who call themselves
sociologists, one might find as many shades of opinion as he would among
the large number of persons who call themselves Christians. Unlike
biology, or astronomy, or mathematics, there is as yet no definite set
of fundamental principles upon which all sociologists agree. The
difficulty which Mr. Herbert Spencer has pointed out in his excellent
treatise on the Study of Sociology, is that sociology deals with human
activity, which presents many difficulties of interpretation. The
opponents of the science have said that no such science could exist,
because human action could never be foretold on account of the operation
of the element of the free will. Man’s will being free, it is argued,
means that man’s actions are determined more by desire, whim, impulse
and caprice, than by law. While certain causes will produce certain
results when all the factors are purely physical, it may be different
when the human will enters, for the same stimuli may produce very
different results. What makes one man laugh, may cause another to cry;
what affects one man one way today, may affect him differently tomorrow,
and still differently the next day. An iron ball let loose at the top of
a hill will follow the line of least resistance, till it reaches the
bottom of the hill, unless stopped by some outside force. Here the law
of gravitation has full play. And not only will one iron ball, but every
iron ball, and every wooden ball, or stone ball, will show,
approximately, the same influence of gravitation. But a man may start
down hill, in fact, be pushed down, but he may go only half way and turn
back, or turn to the left, or to the right, or stop still because of no
outside influence, and only because of his will, his own desire. Hence,
the difficulty in judging men’s actions. Hence, the impossibility of a
science of human activity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is great difficulty in judging human action in
order to get material for social law, if such were possible. In human
action, as no where else, men are influenced by personal or social point
of view. If the man is a Jew, all things appear to him from the Jewish
point of view; if he is a lawyer, he has a legal bias (as Mr. Spencer
calls it), or if he is a rich man, he will have the bias of the wealthy.
Take any set of phenomena, there will be as many different opinions as
there are different biases, each firmly held to be the correct opinion
or point of view. But all serious students agree that it is this very
bias which makes a study worthless from a strictly, scientific point of
view, for until we can get out of our personal feelings, we cannot be
said to have achieved anything which is scientific.</p>
<h3 id="the-scientific-point-of-view-is-impersonal">The Scientific Point
of View is Impersonal</h3>
<p>The sociologist, to be scientific, should attempt at least to
approach human phenomena in just the same spirit as the biologist would
approach phenomena of life. The questions of race, or social relations,
or of government, or family, or of labor and capital, must be treated by
the sociologist as no more his personal concern than is a piece of dirt
to the geologist, or a flower to the botanist, or a snake the personal
concern of the zoologist. No botanist would be turned from his careful
study of flowers because the roses grew in his yard, or because they
were his wife’s favorite flowers. No geologist would be expected to pay
more personal attention to geological conditions in his native country
than in his enemy’s country, and when he examines them the question of
personal likes and dislikes has absolutely nothing to do with it. The
chemical analysis of materials is a thing entirely apart from the
possession of these materials by any individual, or from any preference
which the chemist may have. If he is examining the blood of a
billionaire or a king, he is no more influenced than if he is examining
the blood of a criminal. The point of view of science is entirely
impersonal. One of the best illustrations of this is in the case of
President Ira Remsen, of Johns Hopkins University. He discovered
saccharin, a substance many times sweeter and cheaper than sugar, which
was used as a substitute for sugar. On this hung most of Remsen’s
reputation as a chemist and benefactor of humanity; but when later study
showed that saccharin was injurious to the digestive organs, he, a true
scientist, did not hesitate to disapprove its use in foods. There is no
such thing as passion or anger in science. There is no such thing as
sentimental approval or disapproval in science. Facts, and facts alone,
count in science. The scientist’s business is to find out what the facts
are, not to make them; to find out the course of evolution and not to
direct that course.</p>
<p>Now, until we can approach facts of social life in such a spirit, we
cannot be said to have a science of sociology. A sociologist who is
black ought not to have a different point of view from that of one who
is white. He is not interested in proving any superiority of his race or
of any other race. Whatever the facts show, that the sociologist grasps.
Applied sociology has been likened to applied medicine. We would not
expect a physician, if his child had tuberculosis, to treat it for a
pain in the arm, but <em>to</em> treat it for tuberculosis. There are
diseases which point to immorality, and yet he would be an
unprofessional physician, who, after diagnosing the case, would treat a
man for catarrh, where it was clear that he had syphilis, or some other
disease of that class. The physician must be guided by facts, not good
wishes, nor the feelings of his patients, no matter how rich or learned
and influential or how poor and despised they are.</p>
<p>It would be clearly as unprofessional for the sociologist to pander
to the prejudices of his community merely for money, or popular
applause, or because he has not the moral courage to withstand them. as
it would be for the physician. The scientist is the man of knowledge,
and he should not be led by the ignorance of the mob.</p>
<h3 id="impersonal-point-of-view-must-be-contended-for">Impersonal Point
of View Must Be Contended For</h3>
<p>The stand which the sociologist must take to-day is not new, and he
must not be surprised if his community is slow to hear real facts. One
of the most impersonal of the sciences is astronomy. No man thinks of
putting his personal feelings into the study of the stars. But the
science of astronomy had to contend for centuries in order to gain this
impersonal point of view. It not only had to fight the ignorance of the
rabble, but the learning of the pseudo learned. It first had to fight
the church, the most powerful organization in the world at that time.
And this was its greatest enemy. Most people who claim to be religious
and to be led by their consciences, feel that conscience is somehow the
voice of God, and whatever their conscience approves is unquestionably
right. Many, therefore, have been willing to die for their consciences’
sake. So, a thousand years ago, when men read in the Bible about the
four corners of the earth, they were sure that the earth was flat, with
four corners. Any one who wrote or spoke against this point of view, was
considered by the general public both ignorant of the state of things
and unfaithful to religion.</p>
<h3
id="astronomys-contention-for-the-impersonal-point-of-view">Astronomy’s
Contention for the Impersonal Point of View</h3>
<p>When Copernicus asserted that the earth was not the center of the
universe, that it was merely a small part of a great system which moved
around the sun, which was the center, he did not have the support of
public opinion. Many thought he was mad; that his mind was unbalanced.
Did not the Bible speak of the sun rising and setting, and did not we
see it move over the earth, from East to West? Do we not know that the
earth is not moving? For if it were, how could we stand on it? Did not
Joshua command the sun to stop in its course around the earth? Thus Holy
Writ was brought in to substantiate the popular view against the
scientist. Copernicus was treated as an infidel, and in those days when
the Church ruled the sciences, as well as the conscience, Copernicus’
books were burned and he was silenced. A few years later there came
Galileo, who had about the same experience. He claimed to have made
discoveries which the popular mind did not believe, and he was forced to
deny what he had scientifically discovered, in order to escape popular
prejudice and persecution. Such was the case also of Kepler, who was
brought before the Church Council and made to take back what he had
publicly stated, and which, of course, we now know to be true. We look
back at that day and pity the poor people’s consciences, which made them
do unreasonable things, and it is sufficient evidence to say that
conscience in the scientific matters indicated was not God’s voice.
Astronomy, by following the facts rather than the whims of men, has won
the day.</p>
<h3 id="geography-had-also-to-contend">Geography Had Also To
Contend</h3>
<p>The first geographers and astronomers who claimed that the earth was
round were brought up before church councils and were made to attempt to
prove their contention by the Bible, and were disgraced when they stated
to the world that the earth was round. Even as late as the time of
Christopher Columbus, the geographer was not free from public censure.
He was persecuted because he declared that the western part of the world
could be reached by sailing east. He was thought, so the great mass of
people thought, because he did not adhere to popular opinion, but time
has proved him wiser than the mob, and posterity calls him one of the
makers of geography, and we honor him as a benefactor of the world.
To-day we laugh at the man who says that the earth is flat, or that he
sees the sun rise and set, and who talks literally, about the four
corners of the earth. We have, of course, changed our view of the Bible
and our consciences as well have changed to suit our science. But this
never would have been had scientists not contended for consideration of
facts, and facts alone.</p>
<p>The geologist has also had to fight his way for the impersonal point
of view. There are men living to-day who have called the geologist the
worst of infidels. Do not the tradition and the Bible say, if we take
their interpretation, that Hell is a burning lake, and do they not make
the Bible locate it in the bowels of the earth? When the geologist
explains his view of the earth, making no place for a Hell within, and
declares that this earth is only eight thousand miles through, he was
promptly branded as an infidel by those who judged by their prejudice
and their consciences, rather than by the facts. Similarly when the
geologist said this earth was hundreds of thousands of years of age, men
whose opinions were not based upon a study of facts, gave the geologist
all kinds of abuse. But to-day, we accept complacently, practically
everything which the geologist claimed in this regard. And so the
botanist and the zoologist and the biologist.</p>
<h3 id="biology-vs.-popular-prejudice">Biology vs. Popular
Prejudice</h3>
<p>The biologist is just now fighting his battle and just now winning.
We remember, when a small boy, how sinful it was said to be, even to
read the books of Darwin and Herbert Spencer and Huxley, Tyndall and
other advocates of the theory of evolution. They claimed that the
present state of the earth was an evolution, that various forms of life
had evolved from other forms, and that the probability was that we all
came from a lower form, and have been thousands and thousands of years
evolving. Popular prejudice was at once aroused, and pious ministers
felt called upon to preach sermons against evolution. To be called an
evolutionist was equivalent to being called an infidel. Men were turned
out of the church for espousing the cause of evolution. Earnest
preachers resigned their pulpits when they became “converted” to
evolution. To-day, very few intelligent, well-trained ministers object
to evolution, but in the back woods, where intelligence has not yet
penetrated, they are still fighting against evolution, believing they
are fighting the battle of conscience and of religion. But the contest
has gone far enough to assure us practically that the biologist will win
his point of view, and the man whose only information is traditional,
though he even use his conscience to uphold his prejudice, will go down
before the biologist as he always has gone down before the astronomer
and zoologist, under the convincing weight of scientific facts. The
scientist must, therefore, never fear to combat human prejudice.</p>
<h3 id="sociologys-task">Sociology’s Task</h3>
<p>Sociology is just now beginning the fight, and I have reviewed these
matters of history to show that we must fight if we are going to
establish a science. We have human prejudice to fight, we have</p>
<p>the consciences of the uninformed to fight; their bias, Mr. Spencer
would call it. Does not the Bible say for example, that Ham was cursed,
and do not millions of Christians believe that the reason of the
oppression of black people is because God cursed them through Ham? Did
Jehovah not say, “Servant of servants shalt thou be,” etc., and did not
the black man bear the cross of Jesus Christ, showing that even the
Founder of Christianity put upon Negroes the “curse” of doing the hard
work? It is difficult for us, human beings as we are, to overcome this
prejudice, but the history of science shows that until we combat it and
with facts, beat it down, as have the astronomers, the geographers, the
geologists, the biologists and others, we can never hope to establish
firmly the right of sociology to stand as one of the great sciences.</p>
<h2 id="the-negro-problem">The Negro Problem</h2>
<p>Now, you see the position in which I am. As one who believes a
science of sociology is a possibility, and who humbly takes to himself
the name of a student of sociology, I find myself in the quandary; shall
I be true to the facts without regard to my personal feelings or to
yours; without regard to your prejudices or your consciences or your
tradition, or shall I stand before you and tell you what you want to
hear, to please you? Shall I pander to you, or shall I have the courage
of a Galileo, or a Kep-lar, or Spencer, or a Huxley, and go away from
here with your disapproval, rather than with your applause, because I do
not give you the things which uphold your prejudices? As a would-be
scientist, there is but one thing which I can do and that is to give you
the facts as they are.</p>
<h3 id="study-of-race-problems">Study of Race Problems</h3>
<p>In the study of the facts of human activity, the very condition of
scientific value must be the accuracy and impartiality of the
observation of students. For accurate observation the student must be
tolerant and open-minded. He must be widely acquainted with the history
and condition of peoples in the different parts of the world, that he
shall be entirely rid of his national, sectional, racial, religious and
political bias. In spite of his race and religion and early education he
ought to be able to look upon the facts of society entirely from the
impersonal point of view.</p>
<p>This is especially necessary in the study of nationalities and races
different from our own. We are very liable to underrate these peoples,
to consider their mental and physical differences as mental and physical
inferiorities; to call their religion heathen, to look upon their racial
tendencies as downward if they are not as ours. This will give us a
provincial philosophy, but nothing of real scientific value.</p>
<p>We are especially apt to be led by the prejudice of our environment
in studying a hostile race, one with whom we have lately had war, or a
race our environment considers inferior, a recently enslaved race. And
here is our difficulty in studying the Negro and his problems.</p>
<h3 id="the-negro-problem-is-a-social-problem">The Negro Problem is a
Social Problem</h3>
<p>In what consists the particular and peculiar Negro race problem of
which we hear so much?</p>
<p>A social problem may be said to exist with reference to any
particular group, when there is in any way maladjustment of that group
with respect to its environment. Then, the Negro problem must be a
social problem of maladjustment between the Negro group and its American
environment. A social problem is a Negro problem in so far as the social
maladjustment is first, common to the great mass of the Negro group, and
second, peculiar to it. It is not a Negro problem if the maladjustment
is not common to the entire Negro group, that is, all Negroes suffer it;
or, it is not peculiar to the Negro group, that is, only Negroes suffer
it. This, we must get clearly in our minds if we are to understand the
problem of the Negro.</p>
<h3 id="what-the-negro-problem-is-not">What The Negro Problem Is
Not</h3>
<p>Much confusion already prevails as to just what this maladjustment
is, and to avoid further confusion careful analysis is necessary. The
average man with whom I have come in contact, identifies in some way,
the Negro problem with the problem of ignorance and vice, or with
poverty and immorality, or with industrial inefficiency, unemployment or
some other pathological social conditions.</p>
<p>One says, if it were not for the ignorance of the Negro, there would
be no problem. But let us examine this and we will see that the Negro
problem is not a problem of illiteracy or ignorance. In the first place,
illiteracy is not common to the Negro race, for the majority of them can
read and write. In the second place, illiteracy is not peculiar to them
as a race, for there are more white illiterates in this country than
Negro illiterates. In 1900 the census gave 3,200,069 as the number of
white illiterates, and 2,853,194 as the number of Negro illiterates in
the country. There are, according to the same census, fourteen times as
many white illiterates in the State of Pennsylvania as Negro
illiterates, while by the same authority in proportion to population,
there is less illiteracy among the younger generation of Negroes living
in the North, than in the same class of whites living in the South. The
throngs which come to our great cities have a great deal more ignorance
among the foreign white element than among the Negroes. It is plain,
therefore, that ignorance and illiteracy are not the Negro problem,
although many Negroes, as well as many whites, are involved in the
general problem of ignorance, which has no color whatever.</p>
<h3 id="not-a-question-of-poverty">Not a Question of Poverty</h3>
<p>Nor is the Negro problem to be identified with the poverty problems
for all the Negroes are not poor, nor are they a large proportion of the
poor among them. To refer again to the census, the special report on
“Paupers in Almshouses” shows that there were on December 31, 1903,
81,764 paupers in the almshouses of the country; 74,854 were white and
6,910 colored, including Chinese and Indians. Indeed, of the foreign
whites the proportion was more than four times as great as that of the
Negroes, according to the population of each group. Poverty is a
condition of a gradually decreasing group of Negroes, but is not the
group’s peculiar problem. Like ignorance, poverty has no color. A visit
to the slums of New York, Chicago, Philadelphia or New Orleans will
convince the dullest mind that the problem of poverty and the Negro
problem are not one and the same.</p>
<p>Nor is the Negro problem one of crime. In the city of Philadelphia,
where I have gone over the police records and reports very carefully, I
find that the Negro criminal class is but a small fraction of the whole
group of Negroes, the great mass being law-abiding and respectable
working men and women. By the best figures available there are probably
fifteen white persons in the criminal class to every criminal Negro. Nor
is general depravity, immorality, the Negro’s peculiar problem. I might
go through a whole list of things which superficial people call the
Negro problem, but that is unnecessary if you appreciate the principle
involved.</p>
<p>I do not mean to say that these pathological conditions are not real
among the Negro race as among the whites, for such an assertion would be
untrue, but I do mean to impress that it is confused thinking which
identifies the Negro problem with any of the above-mentioned problems,
and that such confusion leads to serious error and an indefinite
postponement of any solution, or harmonious adjustment of racial
relations.</p>
<p>By way of illustration, let us suppose that when we should awake
to-morrow morning we should find that all possible means of identifying
the Negroes had disappeared and we could not tell them from other men,
but that they still remained the same in character and ability. It is
clear that we should have no more Negro problem, but it is not clear
that we should not have just as the day before, various problems of
crime, poverty, ignorance, immorality, etc. We should then be convinced
that these problems, which still exist, are not the Negro problem.</p>
<h3 id="what-the-problem-is">What the Problem Is</h3>
<p>What, then, is the Negro problem? What maladjustment is at the same
time common to the Negro group as a whole, and peculiar to it as over
against the white group? Sociology, whose field of study is the social
mind, so to speak, furnishes the ready answer, after a careful analysis
of the condition. That answer is that the Negro problem is in the
attitude of the American public mind toward the Negro race, an attitude
which insists upon separating the Negro group from the general group,
and labeling the Negro according to his color alone without regard to
his character. It is this attitude attitude which continually seeks and
exaggerates imaginary “race differences,” and is anxious about “the
place of the Negro,” not allowing the Negro to find his own level or
place as other men do. It makes race, rather than character and
efficiency, or lack of these, the reason for difference. This attitude
is the maladjustment common to all Negroes and peculiar to them.</p>
<p>The attitude is seen in a thousand things; it is sometimes loud and
uncivil, as in the cases of the Rev. Thomas Dixon’s or James K.
Vardaman’s, or Senator Tillman’s agitations, or it is quiet and polite,
as in the case of a Northern employer who refuses the Negro applicant
for promotion, or for a place other than in menial service, merely on
the ground of his color rather than fitness. It is unsuspectingly
reflected by many good housewives, who say, “I don’t want a Negro girl
to work for me, for I have had one and she was unsatisfactory,” not
thinking that if she used the same reasoning with girls she would be
forced to do all her work herself. Or it is seen in the laborers who
will not work with a competent Negro foreman, or the clerks who threaten
to strike if a Negro is put on the force. It is causing gradual
segregation in the public schools; has caused it in the Christian
church, and threatens to make the brotherhood of Christ spoken of, a
hollow mockery in America.</p>
<h3 id="evil-results">Evil Results</h3>
<p>This attitude causes general weakness and waste. First, in the Negro
it causes general demoralization, and thus complicates the problem of
inefficiency, poverty, etc., which some mistake for the Negro problem.
It encourages, in Negroes, low ideals, in that it separates them from
the community, and says to them in so many words that the best is not
for them.</p>
<p>But it has a bad effect upon the community, for it deprives the
manufacturer and the business man in general of a very valuable labor
supply. It also, by causing labor unions to discriminate against
Negroes, robs the cause of labor of a powerful ally. How powerful this
ally is, was only hinted at when, with the aid of less than 500 Negroes,
the meat packers of Chicago were able to break the stockyards strike of
1904, and with still fewer Negroes, the teamsters’ strike, in 1905,
involving 100,000 whites, was broken. These strikes were veritable
industrial wars. But Negroes are not strike-breakers by choice. They are
from necessity of self-protection, for the average laboring man has not
seen that the interests of black and white labor can be the same because
of the attitude referred to. The attitude has weakened the church.
Ministers who preach for African missions are often, because of this
attitude, afraid to say a kind word for the Negro in America or to visit
their Negro parishioners. Thus those who should preach and lead the
world to that great ideal of the Christ Master are actually going back
on this ideal in so far as the Negro is concerned. It has made the
democracy of which we dreamed, only a dream. It has caused white men of
the South, fearing an impossible hallucination of “Negro domination,” to
vote solidly, irrespective of conviction, on purely political affairs,
and it is the chief corner-stone for the building up of a system of
caste in a proposed democracy. Because of this attitude of separation,
no Negro is safe in any community, nor is his family or his property.
Try as we may, we can never protect a people who are psychologically
separate. They will always be the prey of the larger group.</p>
<h3 id="the-solution">The Solution</h3>
<p>Such is the Negro problem; such, some of its far-reaching results.
Can it be solved? How? It can be solved. But it is not to be solved from
without; by merely working on Negroes. Education of the Negroes does not
solve it; nor does amassing of property by them, or becoming
self-respecting and law-abiding. Indeed, the most bitter and savage
outbreak of race feeling we have had in years occurred in the city of
Atlanta, which has more Negro colleges than any other city in the
country, and in a community where nearly every Negro’s home was owned by
himself, and which had been publicly praised by the Mayor for being so
law-abiding as to need no policemen. Men who were attacked and
mishandled by the mob of whites included graduates from Yale University,
Boston University, two presidents of a college and others, all
well-to-do, and some, according to Southern standards, wealthy; and,
according to a report of a committee of white citizens of Atlanta, “not
one of the Negroes killed and wounded in the riot was of the criminal
class. Every one was industrious, respectable and law-abiding.” I might
give hundreds, indeed thousands, of facts to show that the problem is
intensified with wealth, industry and culture on the part of Negroes,
and that the less the culture, or the more the degradation, the less is
the problem realized. A poor, illiterate and even vicious and diseased
Negro servant is admitted to the comforts of hotels and palace cars,
when Negroes of culture and wealth are denied.</p>
<p>The problem can only be solved by a change of attitude of the public
mind from that of indifference, opposition or depreciation, to one not
especially favoring the Negroes, but one of fairness and justice and
consideration. Only by awakening the American conscience, which now is
soundly asleep, can this problem find solution. First, the Christian
ministers ought to be leaders in the movement, for they are
theoretically committed to it by the brotherhood teachings of their
Christ. Then the social teachers who have the ideal of democracy ought
to practice and teach the throwing off of this undemocratic distinction.
The business man can give the black man a fair chance without special
favor, and insist upon his right to do so, even though his employees at
first object. The labor leaders can slowly educate the laboring classes
that the interests of all laborers are one. The politician can help the
country greatly by striving to eliminate the race issue. The solution
cannot be accomplished en masse; it is to be a slow change in the mental
attitude of the whole white race.</p>
<h3 id="not-a-hopeless-task">Not a Hopeless Task</h3>
<p>It is not a hopeless task, as developments in this country since the
war have shown. Forty years ago, for example, being a policeman in this
city or clerking in the post office was a “white man’s job;” but one by
one Negroes have entered these places, and though there was protest at
first, scarcely any one objects today. The Midvale Steel Company has
given a valuable lesson in what quiet insistence will do, in that it has
insisted upon letting Negroes come into the plant, and now no one
objects. Thousands of business men have done the same, with a like
experience, thus helping to solve the problem. Indeed, it seems that the
business men have outstripped those to whom we naturally look—the
ministers of the Gospel—in this respect.</p>
<p>Then there is general ignorance of the Negro race. Most people think
they know the Negro, and are unwilling to learn; hence, they make
adjustment more difficult. In speaking of the conference in Atlanta
concerning the riot, Mr. Hopkins, one of Atlanta’s leading lawyers and a
Southerner by birth, is reported to have said: “I believe those Negroes
understood the situation better than we did. I was astonished at their
intelligence and diplomacy … I didn’t know that there were such Negroes
in Atlanta.” Such a statement shows that Mr. Hopkins is making progress
toward the solution of this vexed problem, and like him, leaders of
thought and public-spirited men ought to seek to inform themselves
concerning the real condition, seek to co-operate with the best Negroes
and patiently work for the truer and purer democracy.</p>
<p>This, of course, demands a deal of moral courage; often a bit of
sacrifice for principle, which in being worked out will not only relieve
the Negroes, but strengthen the white race even more. To recapitulate
then: The Negro problem is the problem of mental attitude of whites
toward the Negro, preventing the assimilation of Negroes into American
economic life. It, therefore, robs the country of much economic benefit,
making progress slower, and even retarding business development (as when
the bank clearings of Atlanta fell thousands of dollars after the riot),
depriving the labor cause of one of its most leadable and teachable
allies. This attitude demoralizes Negroes, crushes ambition, but aids
crime and immorality and tends to increase poverty. The Negro problem
can be solved only by awakening the sleeping conscience of the whites,
who dominate. This solution of the Negro problem will be the greatest
achievement of American democracy and Christianity. Patience,
toleration, contact and co-operation with the best of the Negroes,
differentiation as to character and efficiency, rather than color, and
constant insistence upon human rights to work, to live, to progress,
instead of the emphasis of the superiority of whites over blacks, are
some of the factors and forces which will bring about the change, and
all men of intelligence and patriotism ought to lead in bringing it
about.</p>
<p>I would not close without paying a well-deserved tribute to W. D.
Weatherford, a Secretary of the International Committee of the Y.M.C.A.
among the colleges for white men of the South. He is a Southern man of
culture, and he has written a book on <em>The Negro in the South,</em>
the best book written by a Southerner, which shows wide knowledge and an
enlightened conscience. I think this is only an indication of what the
Southerner of culture will continue to do when he becomes really
enlightened.</p>
