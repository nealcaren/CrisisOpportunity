<p><span class="pagenum">479</span>This article might be entitled
“Descent from the Ivory Tower,” for the writer, after years of study of
the problem of educating Negroes conducted within college and university
cloisters, has for the past several months been serving as the
administrator of a college. This college is designed to render its major
service in the training of teachers for the Negro elementary schools of
the State.</p>
<p>With other students of the social complex that is the South, the
writer has for several years been viewing, more often with alarm than
otherwise, and as “objectively” as possible, precisely that social and
economic pattern which it is now his duty not only to understand,
interpret, and describe but also to reform. The past research has been
carried on with that grave abstraction appropriate to the scholarly
endeavor; the present responsibility not only calls for a frenzied
attempt to answer the question “Knowledge—for What?” but also
necessitates a transition from preoccupation with the pure science of
society to a somewhat harried effort to make applications.</p>
<p>In this paper it has seemed appropriate for the author to remain in
character for the two separate tasks implied by the subject: to review,
first, what the social sciences have, currently, to tell us regarding
the social complex that includes Negroes in the South; and, second, to
describe what implications there are in these supposedly scientific
facts for an educational institution which, once studied, ceases to be
merely the object of research and becomes the vehicle for effecting
social change.</p>
<h2 id="i"><span class="pagenum">480</span>I</h2>
<p>Just yesterday—Victorian and post-Victorian yesterdays—the
interpretation of the “Negro problem” was either sentimental,
humanitarian, and in terms of eighteenth-century equalitarianism, or it
was of the order of contemporary racism. In the light of the first view,
the Negro was a man and a brother; to be uplifted by educational
missionaries, saved from sin by religious efforts, brought to economic
equality by the twin agents of an “education” and political measures.
The first efforts, in the South, to educate Negroes were carried on
largely by missionary teachers from New England, equalitarians all,
disciples of Calvin on the one hand and Horace Mann on the other. To a
strict insistence on the severest standards of a puritanical moral code
they added the faith in the common man implicit in the New England
common-school revival. It was all to be very simple: spelling books,
temperance lectures, the ballot; and the brother in black would emerge,
no longer a chattel or a serf, but a man, a brother, a citizen.</p>
<p>To give all credit to the host of New England schoolmarms who
followed Grant to Vicksburg and Richmond, Sherman to Atlanta, and Banks
and Butler to New Orleans, the great majority of them soon realized the
terrific nature of the uplift in which they were engaged, but stuck
doggedly to their simple rules, in the midst of tremendous
discouragements, for the rest of their active lives. To their credit be
it said also that they did perform miracles. In each place, they touched
both the children of disorganized ex-slaves and of free people of color,
and under this almost magic touch of the schoolmarm at Hampton, at Fisk,
at the Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary (now Spelman College), there did
emerge from chattels and serfs men and women.</p>
<p>Viewed in perspective, the failure of these missionary teachers to
achieve the goals set was due to three difficulties. In the first place,
they were spread too thinly through the South. Of a population of almost
two million educables of school age at the end of the Civil <span
class="pagenum">481</span>War, not to mention the equally numerous
illiterate adults, the mission schools could touch but a few thousand.
In the second place, the decline of war hysteria and of humanitarianism
in the North meant that replacements and support were scanty. And,
finally, they ran head on in the postreconstruction South into a
nationwide revival of racial dogma that was to persist for a generation,
unequaled anywhere else in the world until the resurgence of race hatred
in Nazi, Jew-hating Germany.</p>
<p>In a number of historical accounts of racial attitudes in the South,
authors find it difficult to explain the virulent race antagonism that
flourished with the advent of such politicians as Ben Tillman in South
Carolina and Vardeman in Mississippi. Many have laid it to the
recalcitrance of the blacks with freedom, to the education, indeed,
which the schoolmarms brought to the ex-slaves. Our newer knowledge,
viewing the breaking of the white class structure as a result of the
Civil War, with the emergence of new leaders from the masses to make
articulate long-smoldering economic hatred of the blacks, may assign the
catastrophic changes in race relations that did take place notably in
the 90’s to the same complex of factors which bred Jew-baiting in
Germany, and that perhaps breeds both Jew and Negro baiting in America
today.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, the schoolmarm fought in a lost cause: lost for
bitter antagonism toward the uplift of the Negro, lost for desperate
financial destitution that made impossible the provision of adequate
funds for the education even of white children. And yet, as suggested
above, the cause was not entirely lost; for in the little academies and
grammar schools, where interrupted promise lent mockery to the
pretentious names of “college” and “university,” men and women were
being educated to do, in their generation, what the missionaries had
been unable to do—staff little schools for little children through the
length and breadth of the land.</p>
<h2 id="ii"><span class="pagenum">482</span>II</h2>
<p>For a time—perhaps now nearing its termination—we have enjoyed a
reasonably objective appreciation and study of the problem presented in
this country by the juxtaposition of what, it may be agreed, are diverse
“races.” As opposed both to humanitarianism and racism, there has
developed a theory for the interpretation of race relations in America
which is studiously environmentalistic and materialistic. Beginning with
the conviction that economic classes best characterize major trends in
historical development, it defines the Negro group as a subordinate
caste within the whole, itself stratified into various discrete economic
and social classes.</p>
<p>Because of the persistence of social classes for a longer or shorter
period after the economic classes that spawned them have begun to
crumble, the role of the Negro caste is seen externally as helping to
define social and economic class within the white group. The biracial
world, with functions of an economic society poorly defined, results in
the re-creation in the Negro caste of an approximation of the class
structure characteristic of the white world without. There are
“upper-class” Negroes as there are “upper-class” white persons, each as
defined within their own group; but a sharp line separates the most
“upper-class” Negroes from the farthest down “lower-class” white
man.</p>
<p>Whatever the structure—and it is highly debatable that the caste-like
contemporary status of Negroes may be defined, in a culture so subject
to change as is ours, as a true caste—it is obvious that the theory
gives a highly valuable frame of reference for evaluating the
structure.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> It adds light to an estimation of
social values, and to a study of institutions, for both races. Indeed,
it aids in appraising <span class="pagenum">483</span>types of
individual personality within both races, but its greatest value, for
this essay, lies in the interpretation it may give to the
institution—the elementary school for Negro children—with which we are
immediately concerned.</p>
<p>Another qualifying factor in the caste-class relations of the two
races, and of the institutions which are part of the cultural pattern,
is the simple fact of great poverty in the section where the majority of
blacks live. Whether cause or effect, the fact that the South is poor
adds and subtracts all along the line of biracial contacts. Here is a
section with, relatively, most of the children and least of the wealth.
Here is a section, likewise, where separate schools and the political
implications of a “superior” and an “inferior” race permit a choice in
the distribution of what few funds are available. Discrimination in the
expenditure of public funds for Negro children, visible everywhere in
the United States where Negro children represent the vast majority of
children enrolled in a school (from Harlem to Chicago), is axiomatic in
such a depressed economy. Perhaps the most significant index to the
influence of the economic factor in the education of Negroes in the
South is that it is possible to find urban communities where per capita
expenditures for Negro children are higher than in certain rural areas
for white children, where the white population finds itself concentrated
on poor, hilly land.</p>
<p>If the South had greater resources, it would not be the South. If
Mississippi had tax-yielding resources similar to those of California,
it would not be the Mississippi we know, nor would the relations of
Negroes and of whites be as they are. Yet, if a change in the
concentration of wealth can be imagined, without a change in the
proportion of Negroes in the population, it would mean that Mississippi
would no longer have to apply a tax rate thirteen times as high as
California’s to yield comparable educational revenue for each black or
white child in the State; and, by that token, the prospect for the Negro
elementary school in Mississippi, regardless of caste or of class, would
be entirely changed.</p>
<h2 id="iii"><span class="pagenum">484</span>III</h2>
<p>In addition to the insights that contemporary study of society has
given into the nature of the structures involving Negroes and white
persons in the South, there are equally valuable concepts regarding the
nature of the process of accommodation that have recently come to light.
In the face of horrifying descriptions of race conflict in any
historical period, whether it be ante-bellum accounts of slavery,
reminiscences of the horrors of Reconstruction, or contemporary analyses
of trouble points, the fact remains that both whites and blacks involved
in each of these periods have been human beings, with an immense
capacity for accommodating themselves to difficulties which can easily
be magnified, both in historical and spatial perspective. Negro slaves
did not spend all of their lives grieving at their sad condition. White
Southerners during Reconstruction spent less time agonizing at what was
going on about them than have Messrs. Dixon, Griffith, Selznick, and
Miss Mitchell; and indeed it is a moot question whether more tears were
shed by the Negroes of <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em> and the whites of
<em>The Clansman</em>, or by the readers of those classics.</p>
<p>People must eat, love, sleep, gossip, hate, whether black or white,
regardless of caste or class, in the ante-bellum period or today. For a
valuable picture of the machinery of accommodation, or, rather, of the
lubrication of the machinery by which white and black manage to live
bearable lives in contact with each other, we owe much to Doyle’s
<em>The Etiquette of Race Relations in the South</em>.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Theories of race adjustment must be in terms of generalities.
Accommodations, however much cast in the general pattern, must be
individual in nature. No general rule exists for these particularized
adaptations of “etiquette.” Stated another way, the general rule of
caste would be so paralyzing to day-by-day behavior in the South that
individual exceptions of a personal nature become the rule. The <span
class="pagenum">485</span> South may be in process of becoming
impersonalized as it grows industrial and urban; but where black meets
white is still a realm of personal behavior.</p>
<p>This is important for all institutions, and particularly for such an
institution as the school. All aspects of the administration of schools,
for example, take on different meaning as compared to the general rule.
The impersonalized role of a school teacher in a large urban center,
where he may impersonally form associations and even unions for the
improvement of his lot, has no counterpart in decentralized systems
where teacher stands neighbor or kin to board member or superintendent.
In even greater degree, though now subject to rapid change, is this true
of schools for Negroes. The employment of a school supervisor, and a
public greeting by the superintendent as “Gertrude” or “Sallie” is not
always an effort to “put the supervisor in her place.” Sometimes it is
part of the personal touch which in turn is part of the pattern. There
have been Negro college presidents who have been scorned by fellow
Negroes because of their apparent predilection for fishing and hunting
with influential white persons. The scoffers betray their ignorance of
the pattern. The Negro may not golf or play bridge or chat informally at
lunch with his white friend; but he may, honestly and with self-respect,
bridge the chasm of race in an area into which the wavering line of
caste does not extend.</p>
<p>Fear of the “furriner” is not confined to Negro-white relations. As
one educator has said, school teachers from the Bronx are not overly
welcome in Iowa. Perhaps even more than with white persons, however, the
suspicion of “Negro furriners”—persons who might disturb the delicate
balance of race adjustment in a community that feels well satisfied with
its “solution”—is characteristic.</p>
<h2 id="iv"><span class="pagenum">486</span>IV</h2>
<p>Reference has been made above to the importance of gross economic
differentials in the relative support that may be expected to go to
white and Negro schools in the South. As a dual function of die
caste-economic structure, the limitation of economic opportunities for
Negroes poses a difficult question for institutions designed to educate
Negro children. In the professions Negroes are limited largely to
services which they can render for their own people; and the low income
of Negroes, together with the disadvantages under which Negro
professionals labor in disposing of their wares, or in giving their
clients the greatest return for payment, severely restricts the degree
to which it may be expected that Negro professionals can monopolize
services for Negroes. Discriminations that bar Negroes almost entirely
from distributive occupations, from large-scale clerical fields, from
skilled crafts, and, more recently, even from the underpaid hard labor,
formerly “Negro,” jobs are all matters of serious concern to those who
would formulate an adequate or effective educational program. The
problem of “general” versus “vocational” education is difficult enough
in planning the education of young white people, who, presumably, have
merely the hazards of a disorganized world economic structure with which
to contend. How much more profound is the dilemma of one who would plan
intelligently for the education of Negro youth, who, in addition to the
frightful state of the common social and economic structure surrounding
us all, is confronted with an endless succession of special difficulties
due to race!</p>
<p>Perhaps this gloomy reflection provides as satisfactory a juncture as
any to consider the second separate task set forth as the aim of this
paper; namely, the discussion of the implications which sociological
knowledge has for the education of Negro children.</p>
<p>Knowledge—for what?</p>
<p>It is plain that only he whose occupation is social research could
content himself with the bare analysis of what, in sober truth, seems
<span class="pagenum">487</span> to be a desperate prospect for Negro
youth. At the risk of stepping too brazenly from the role of social
analyst—and Jeremiah—to that of reformist—and Pollyanna—this writer
would posit, on the part of those engaged in the education of Negro
children, the necessity of harking back a century to the promoters of
the New England common-school revival, and their belief, not only in the
“improvability of mankind,” but also in the essential possibility of
achieving such an improvement by means of planned processes and
institutions. In perspective, the condition and prospect for Negroes,
and for the American culture of which they are a part, need not
discourage optimism. The intangibles defy measurement; but even the
tangibles might bear some weight in an estimation of the effect of
formal education and educational institutions upon the status of Negroes
since the time, seventy-five years ago, when the schoolmarm began to
“uplift” the race. Are Negroes happier today than then? It is debatable.
We do know that such indices as infant mortality, illegitimacy,
tuberculosis, and family disorganization show decreasing ratios, and,
over a long-time span, gratifying decreases. Such a volume as Frazier’s
<em>The Negro Family in the United States</em><a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> is
not only a magnificent sociological essay; it is also an exciting
portrayal of the growth of social organization, of greater integration,
over a period long enough to discount lag, slips, and collapse, and give
cause to what may, indeed, be an entirely unscientific basis for the
kind of faith that motivated the early missionaries.</p>
<p>In this process the elementary school for Negroes has indubitably
played a large part in furnishing Negroes, however inadequately as yet,
with the tools basic to participation in the American culture. Even the
gloomiest portions of the picture of Negro social organization help
define the functions—in high relief—of the school in which Negro
children are enrolled. That school must choose its task with relation to
the problems which social research helps define, <span
class="pagenum">488</span>but always with reference to that (highly
unscientific?) guide to action known as “The American Dream.”</p>
<p>In the America of the dream—may it not also be an America compatible
with the science of sociology?—there is a place for an institution whose
function is the improvement of mankind. Such an institution, for the
lowest stratum of the nation’s economic pyramid, for the lowest stratum
of the nation’s social pyramid, must have a consciousness of the
persistence of social structures, the immense inertia of the social
mechanism. It must—if, indeed, institutions may be
self-conscious—attempt an intelligent appraisal of the ways and degrees
in which its task differs from that of similar institutions designed for
integrating children into the general pattern of American life. This it
must do while viewing the common goal. If, through the persistence for
several centuries of various species of racial disadvantages, its
clientele lacks skills and understandings common to the average of other
populations, this institution needs to modify its methods and to be
content to reach first the apparent needs. Its primary function might be
expressed as that of creating a literate population (as a cynic might,
indeed, propose as an unrealized function of all American schools).
Beyond this, the school for Negro children must socialize the Negro
child, first, as a member of an underprivileged economic class, and,
second, as a member of a despised social group—at the best, a
semicaste.</p>
<p>And here the personalities of social analyst and reformer find final
disassociation. To teach children to read—when their parents are
illiterate, and the culture too destitute to provide material for them
to read. To teach children to be clean, when the housing afforded by the
economic system, the type of labor engaged in, the pitiful clothing they
have money to buy make cleanliness, neatness, order a task for Hercules.
To teach children to have self-respect, when the structure, we are told,
negates self-respect, because it negates racial respect. To teach
children respect for life, when the high homicide rate of their parents,
we are told, derives from the pattern <span class="pagenum">489</span>of
violence woven by the superior caste to keep the lower caste
subordinated. Yes—each is to be done. The schoolmarms did it, and so
must we.</p>
<p>As it brings into sharp relief the difficulties inherent in social
change, sociology also makes realistic the long-time character of any
change. This patience with institutions is a great virtue. If, to
understanding and patience, there can be added something of the opposite
impatience with things as they are that characterized the early
missionary teachers, the fourth generation of Negroes since the
schoolmarms first came should be best equipped of all for the slow
process of acculturation.</p>
