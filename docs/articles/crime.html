<p><em>Abstract <span class="pagenum">472</span> of an address delivered

Hampton Conference.</em></p>

<p>The criminal status of the Negro race is a matter that should be
carefully weighed and investigated, and cautious and reasoned conclusion
deduced therefrom. The anti-Negro doctrinaires are ever prone to seize
upon the surface appearance of things criminal and utilize them to
blacken and blast the reputation of the race.</p>
<p>The census of 1890 made a study of criminal statistics. Although the
Twelfth Census made no such investigation, there was a special bulletin
issued in 1904, which made a partial examination of criminal
statistics.</p>
<p>The one essential fact, so far as the Negro race is concerned, is
that twelve per cent. of the population contributed thirty-two per cent.
of the crimes of the United States. This ratio was practically the same
for 1890 and 1904. During the interval of fourteen years there has been
no absolute increase in Negro crime, but in some <span
class="pagenum">473</span> instances there was a relative increase, as
compared with that of the white population.</p>
<p>In 1890 there were 24,227 Negro prisoners in the United States. In
1904 there were 26,870 such prisoners. Although there was some
discrepancy in the methods of return at the two census periods, the
underlying fact remains that the criminal status of the race had made no
notable increase, as compared with the growth of the Negro population
during the intervening fourteen years.</p>
<p>The sociologist first ascertains the facts. Then he accounts for and
interprets them. Finally, he generalizes upon them and points out their
prophetic import. The orator, on the other hand, first generalizes and
prophesies, and afterwards finds it necessary to ascertain the facts
lying at the basis of his generalization and prophecy. Now the fact is
that the Negro has a criminal record about three times as great as his
numbers entitle him to. How shall we account for this? If one should go
to England or to any other part of the earth and study the condition of
the people who live in poverty in the crowded cities, he would find an
overwhelming preponderance of crime among the submerged elements as
compared with the general population. The Negro shows this high criminal
rating because he constitutes, in the United States and especially in
the large cities, the submerged stratum where the bulk of actionable
crime is found the world over. Crime is a question of condition, not of
color.</p>
<p>Another reason, in my judgment, which contributes to the seeming
increase in Negro crime is the fact that during the last fifteen years
there has grown up, on the part of the white race, a spirit of racial
exclusiveness and intolerance. This is outwardly manifested in the
public provisions for the sharp separation of the races in all matters
where there is likely to be anything like intimacy of contact. Formerly
there was a kindly personal and patriarchal relation between the races,
but in these latter days it is becoming hard and business like. “If the
Negro offends against the law, let him perish by the law,” is the
prevailing motto and method. A famous English writer some time ago said:
“If you wish to destroy a feeble race, you can do so more easily by the
law than without it. Make the laws as rigid as possible and enforce them
rigidly.” Those who watch events closely must have noticed the
application of this principle in certain parts of the country.</p>
<p>I believe, from observation and examination, that, taking the
Southern courts as a whole, the Negro in some cases is treated unusually
severely, and in others with unusual lenity. Balancing the two extremes,
he gets substantial justice; but there is a difference between fairness
and justice. Fairness consists in equal distribution of favor; justice
in equal application of rights. The laborer in the parable, who entered
at the eleventh hour, was received on terms of compensatory equality
with the one who had borne the heat and burden of the day, but the more
strenuous workman could not accuse the master of the <span
class="pagenum">474</span> vineyard of injustice, but merely of
unfairness. If the Negro gets justice in the Southern courts, the white
man gets less than justice, and this makes an unfair distribution of
penalties.</p>
<p>When Negroes commit crimes among themselves they are not apt to be
punished with undue severity, but when they commit crime against the
white race punishment is sure, swift and severe. On the other hand, when
the white man commits an offense against the Negro, acquittal is almost
sure to follow; and even if convicted he is released with a slight fine
and does not go to swell the prison record of his race. Even where the
white man commits an offence against his own race he is not apt to
receive the full rigor of the law. When two races are living together,
the race which assumes superiority is wont to regard itself as sacred in
the eyes of the other, and is very reluctant to humiliate any of its
members, even by due process of law.</p>
<p>I believe that all will agree that a white person in Massachusetts is
in every way as upright and as well behaved as the white person in any
other place in the world, and yet, if we follow statistics, we find that
the white people in Mississippi are angels of grace as compared with the
white people of Massachusetts. In Massachusetts there are 5,477 whites
in prison; in Mississippi only 114. The ingenuity of the Yankee
sociologist can easily explain away this seeming discrepancy. By the
same process of reasoning, the glaring criminal discrepancy between the
races can be accounted for. There are probably no more white prisoners
in Massachusetts than there ought to be, but no man in his senses, not
even Senator Vardaman, will claim that only 114 white persons in
Mississippi should be “in durance vile.” By parity of reason, it is fair
to say that probably in the South the number of white prisoners falls
immensely below the number of white offenders against the law.</p>
<p>If the entire Negro population should withdraw from the South and its
place be supplied by whites occupying a similar status, the crime rate
of the South would not be appreciably affected. In the United States as
a whole there is an average of one prisoner to every one thousand of the
population. In the South Atlantic states, where the Negro is found in
the largest numbers, the criminal rate is almost exactly the same as
that of the nation at large. In the North Atlantic states, where there
are few Negroes, there is a still higher average, and in the Western
states, where there are no Negroes, comparatively speaking, the rate is
highest of all. It is impossible to trace any connection between race
and crime. If the Negro in the North shows a much higher criminal rate
than the Negro in the South, it is also true that the white race in the
North shows a greater ratio of crime over that same race in the
South.</p>
<p>The Negro in this country is the sacrificial race. He is the burden
bearer of the white race. He constitutes the mud sill of society and
suffers the ills of that lowly place. He performs the rough work <span
class="pagenum">475</span> of society. He suffers the affliction and
even commits the crimes which always fall to the lot of his status. Were
it not for him the white race would suffer corresponding ills. The
Caucasian should appreciate the vicariousness of the black man’s lot and
not strive by false reasoning and force argument to make his burdens
greater than they are.</p>
<p>Just as the Negro death rate, three times as great as that of the
whites, is clearly due to his condition, so his crime rate, bearing the
same disproportion, is also attributable to the same cause.</p>
<p>What should be the attitude of Negro men and women of light and
learning toward this high criminal record and the interpretation just
placed upon it? In the first place, they should strive insistently and
incessantly to reduce this rate. It is always more satisfactory, from a
sociological point of view, to remove an evil than to explain the cause
of its existence. Laws are made for the protection of the weak. It makes
my heart bleed when I see a Negro violating the law, which is his only
safeguard and protection under our scheme of civilization. This
Samsonian folly pulls down the pillars of the temple of justice, the
only asylum for the weak. Colored men should use their best offices to
persuade those who are in control of the lawmaking agencies in the
States and in the nation to enact only such laws as can be cheerfully
upheld and obeyed by all, without compromise of becoming dignity and
self-respect. The white race should enact laws of such equity and
fairness that the Negroes will have no cause to complain of their
unrighteousness and injustice. For if the laws themselves are
unrighteous, where shall we look for righteousness?</p>
<p>Let the Negro obey the Ten Commandments and the white man the Golden
Rule. Then all will be well. Ephraim will not envy Judah, and Judah will
not vex Ephraim.</p>
