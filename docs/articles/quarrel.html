<p><span class="pagenum">903</span> Most treatises on the history and
philosophy of the American labor movement have taken little of the
painstaking inquiry necessary to establish the significance of negro
workers to trade unionism. Many authors who make this omission do so
because of adherence to the popular assumption that since the vast
proportion of negro labor has been devoted to agriculture in the South,
its relationship to the trade union movement, which has been largely in
the industrial North, has been practically nil. The migrations of
negroes from the South to the North have upset this sort of reasoning.
They have shown that this reservoir of Southern black labor, even if
composed chiefly of agricultural, domestic and unskilled workers, could
be tapped by the captains of industry as occasion should warrant, and
that upon the occurrence of stresses in a one-crop agriculture system,
the labor which was devoted almost wholly to the production of its
staple crop, cotton, and which was unorganized, would shift to the
Southern and Northern cities to take its place among the older white
industrial wage earners.</p>
<p>Since 1900 the negro’s importance in mechanical and manufacturing
enterprise has steadily increased. Between 1910 and 1920 the number of
negroes, 10 years and over, gainfully employed in agriculture decreased
24 per cent.; the number in domestic and personal service decreased 5.1
per cent, while in the extraction of minerals the number increased 20.6
per cent., and the manufacturing and mechanical occupations showed an
increase of 125 per cent.</p>
<p>Concomitant with this growing importance of negroes as industrial
wage earners, the question of unionization has become paramount. The
perception of need for organization is reflected by the embittered
criticism of W. E. B. DuBois, Director of Publicity, National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, against the
temporizing policy of the American Federation of Labor; by the National
Urban League’s recently proffered assistance to the federation in
constructing a definite program for the inclusion of negroes in the
various trade unions; by the attempt of negro union members to foster
within the federation a more thorough organization of negroes; by the
present attempt of the negro sleeping and dining car employees to build
a gigantic national organization in these occupations, and by the
propaganda <span class="pagenum">905</span> which is being conducted
among colored workers by the negro radicals affiliated with the Workers
(Communist) Party of America.</p>
<p>At the 1919 convention of the American Federation of Labor the
Committee on Resolutions reported that it had under advisement a
resolution requesting an international charter of colored workers,
another asking for the services of organizers from the federation, and a
third urging that a colored organizer be appointed in every State of the
Union. Another resolution asked that a man, preferably colored, be
stationed at Washington to look after the interest of colored workers,
and another made complaint against the International Union of Metal
Trades for refusing membership to negroes. These recommendations were
adopted and referred to the Executive Council, which was in turn advised
to give special attention to organizing colored workers everywhere.
Similar resolutions had been presented in 1902 and 1907, with little
action resulting. In the same year that the aforementioned petitions
were presented a resolution recommending the organization of colored
Pullman porters, dining car cooks and waiters, train porters, firemen,
switchmen, yard engineers, boilermakers and assistants, machinists and
helpers, headlight tinkers, coach cleaners, laundry workers, shop and
track laborers and section men into a separate colored railway
department, was presented by representatives of the Central Labor
Council of Tacoma, Wash. The resolution read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whereas the influence of world affairs on the present and future
condition of the mass of laborers is such as to make necessary a closer
and more kindred feeling of sympathy and purpose on the part of all
labor; and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whereas this spirit of oneness of purpose can and will only be most
completely achieved when the benefits derived by the efforts of
organized labor arc not predicated on race or creed, or sex or color,
hut rather shall he the common lot and heritage of all; and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whereas, in the past, because of a lack of realization on the part of
the organized white laborer that to keep the unorganized colored laborer
out of the field of organization has only made it easily possible for
the unscrupulous employer to exploit one against the other, to the
mutual disadvantage of each, resulting always in creating that
undemocratic and unchristian thing—race prejudice—and its foul
by-products, riot and mob rule, as during the mine trouble in the
Pacific Northwest in the early ’90s, as more recently on Puget Sound
during the longshoremen’s strike and at East St. Louis; and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whereas it is the duty and should be the privilege of every man or
woman to labor under such conditions and at such times … as will be
conducive to his or her contributing such strength as to effectively aid
our common country and successfully wage the battles of war and to meet
the problems of peace; be it</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Resolved, That we, the undersigned colored railway employees, being
typical colored laborers, do hereby petition the Central Labor Council
of Tacoma, Wash., to give its endorsement to the plea for a plain,
square deal for the colored American laborers; and, be it further</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Resolved, That the Central Labor Council … be and is hereby
petitioned to instruct its dele; gates to the forthcoming convention of
the American Federation of Labor to give us support in applying for an
international charter to organize colored railway employees. …</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="white-unionists-attitude">White Unionists’ Attitude</h2>
<p>A lengthy hearing was held on the subject. The representatives of the
Hodcarriers and Building Laborers, which admitted negroes, and the
Boilermakers, which did not, opposed the adoption of the resolution. The
Committee on Resolutions reported that acceptance and execution of the
aims of the proposal would contravene the jurisdiction of unions of
trades represented in the proposed colored railway department. It said:
“It is not the policy of the American Federation of Labor to grant
charters along racial lines. We know that many international
organizations affiliated with the American Federation of Labor admit
colored workers to membership, and in these organizations their
interests can best be protected and taken care of. There are other
organizations that have not as yet opened their doors to colored
workers, but we hope to see the day in the near future when these
organizations will take a broader view of this matter. Until that time
we urge the Executive Council to organize the colored workers under
charters of the American Federation of Labor.” The committee’s first
statement that the Federation did not issue charters upon a racial basis
conflicts with its last suggestion that the Executive Council organize
colored workers under <span class="pagenum">905</span> charters from the
American Federation of Labor. But even though the Executive Council had
been known to grant charters along racial lines, the colored petitioners
from their experience in the Federation should have known that the
organization of negroes into a separate railway department would violate
the jurisdiction of those unions of trades which admitted negroes and
some of which were to constitute the colored railway department. When
the above resolution was presented fifty-five unions reported that they
admitted negroes. These were:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The United Mine Workers, Textile Workers, Seamen, Cigarmakers,
Teamsters, Longshoremen, Carpenters, Plasterers, Bricklayers,
Maintenance of Way Employees, Laundry Workers, Tunnel and Subway
Workers, Amalgamated Association of Street and Electric Railway
Employees, International Typographical Union, Brick and Clay Workers,
Hodcarriers and Building Laborers, Leather Workers, Blacksmiths, Motion
Picture Players’ Union, American Federation of Teachers, American
Federation of Musicians, Steam and Operating Engineers, Bakers,
Painters, Postal Employees, Decorutors and Paperhangers, Hotel and
Restaurant Employees, Barbers’ International Union, Metal Polishers,
Stereotypers and Electrotypers, Letter Carriers, International Fur
Workers, Civil Engineers’ Association of Boston, Firemen and Oilers,
Quarry Workers, Boot and Shoe Workers and Molders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the response from these unions is an exact measure of the number
which debarred negroes in 1919, it seems that 45 out of the 111
affiliated unions admitted negroes. This response is deceptive. What
many meant by replying affirmatively was that they organized negroes
into separate local unions under their jurisdiction. So these forty-five
affirmative responses should be discounted so as to exclude such unions
as the Painters, the Hotel and Restaurant Employees, the Blacksmiths and
others who maintain separate locals for negro members. It is difficult
to determine what unions and how many reject negro workers on account of
color. Many whose constitutions do not debar negroes offer little
encouragement to them to join. They discourage negro membership by
remaining silent on the issue and should a negro apply for admission,
reject his application. The Structural Iron Workers is a case in point.
There are other unions whose constitutions contain clauses prohibiting
the admission of negroes. Among these are the Machinists, the
Boilermakers, the Railway Mail Association and the Switchmen. On the
other hand, even if a union’s international constitution may not
prohibit negro membership, the policy of its local union determines
whether negro workers in a given community will be organized or not.</p>
<h2 id="local-color-prejudices">Local Color Prejudices</h2>
<p>The position, then, of the negro in the ranks of organized labor is
as much influenced by the racial traditions and customs of the locality
in which a local union exists as by the existence or non-existence of
legislation enacted by the national bodies against negro membership. In
other words, even if the constitution of the national union does not
prohibit membership on account of race, the local union may be compelled
by the racial psychology of its environs to adopt exclusion tactics. In
the light of these conditions the petition for a separate colored
railway department instead of being entirely rejected should have been a
stimulus to the creation of definitive machinery for handling a problem
of race rendered more intricate within the federation by its own
functional and structural characteristics. At a later date the Committee
on Organization directed a conference between several of the
organizations involved in the problem of the colored railway workers.
Two of the organizations were the Brotherhood of Carmen and the
Brotherhood of Boilermakers. When the Carmen’s convention was held in
1921 the following constitutional amendment was adopted: &gt; On
railroads where the employment of colored persons has become a permanent
institution they shall be admitted to membership in separate lodges.
Where there are separate lodges of negroes organized they shall be under
the jurisdiction of the nearest white local and shall be represented in
any meeting of the joint Protective Board, Federation meeting or
convention where delegates may be seated by white members.</p>
<p>The nearest approach toward effecting machinery for the education of
white and black workers as to their common interests came in 1918, when
John R. Shillady, Secretary to the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People; Fred Moore, editor of The New York
<em>Age</em>; Emmet J. Scott, Special Assistant to the Secretary of War;
Thomas Jesse Jones, Educational Director, Phelps Stokes Fund, and Eugene
Kinckle Jones, Secretary to the National Urban League, were requested to
confer upon plans for organizing negro workers. The first meeting was
merely consultative. But six months later Mr. Kinckle Jones of the
National Urban League wrote this letter to the late Samuel Gompers,
President of the American Federation of Labor, in behalf of the
committee:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We write to present suggestions for further cooperation between our
committee and the American Federation of Labor, as growing out of our
recent conference in Washington.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>First, we wish to place before you our understanding of your
statement to us at the conclusion of the meeting. We quote you as
follows, and will be glad to have you make any changes in the text os
will make the statement more nearly conform to the ideas which you have
in mind relative to the connection that should be established between
white and negro workingmen:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“We, the American Federation of Labor, welcome the negro workingmen
to the ranks of organized labor. We should like to see more of them join
us. The interests of workingmen, white and black, are common. Together
we must fight unfair wages, unfair hours and bad conditions of labor. At
times it is difficult for the national organization to control the
actions of local unions in difficulties arising within the trades …;
inasmuch as the national body is made possible by the delegates
appointed by the locals; but we can and will use our influence to break
down prejudice on account of race, color or previous condition of
servitude, and hope that you will use your influence to show negro
workingmen the advantages of collective bargaining and the value of
affiliating with the American Federation of Labor. But few people who
are not thoroughly acquainted with the rapid growth of the American
Federation of Labor know of the large numbers of colored people who are
already members of our organization. The unpleasant incidents in
connection with efforts of colored men to get recognition in trades
controlled by the American Federation of Labor have been aired and the
good efforts of wholesome and healthy relationship have not been given
publicity; and for that reason a general attitude of suspicion has been
developed toward union labor on the port of colored working people; but
I hope that out of this conference will spring a more cordial feeling of
confidence in each other on the part of men who must work for a
living.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We are willing to cooperate with the American Federation of Labor in
bringing about the results of the recent conference arid would make the
following suggestions and recommendations, which, with your approval, we
shall proceed to carry out to the best of our ability:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>First, we suggest that you prepare a statement along the lines of the
quotation from you given above and send it to us for approval and that
it be given to the negro press throughout the country as expressing your
position on ma tiers connected with the relationship between negro and
white workingmen.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This statement, in our judgment, should contain a clear exposition of
the reasons why certain internationals may exclude colored men, as they
do by constitutional provision, and still be affiliated with the
American Federation of Labor, whose declared principles are opposed to
such discrimination. This we think necessary because the stated facts
above alluded to will be familiar to the leaders among the colored
people, particularly to editors and ministers, whose cooperation it is
essential to secure if best results are to be obtained. We would suggest
that you consider the expediency of recommending to such internationals
as still exclude colored men that their constitutions be revised in this
respect.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Second, that a qualified colored man to handle men and organize them
be selected for employment as an organizer of the American Federation of
Labor, his salary and expenses, of course, to be paid by the American
Federation of Labor.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Third, that for the present we meet at least once a quarter to check
on the results of our cooperative activities and to plan for further
extension of the work, if satisfactorily conducted.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fourth, that you carry out your agreement to have your Executive
Council voice its advanced position in its attitude toward the
organization of negro workingmen and have these sentiments endorsed by
your St. Paul convention in June, and this action be given the widest
possible publicity throughout the country. We shall he glad to hear from
you at your earliest convenience as to the action taken by your Council
on these recommendations, with such other suggestions or recommendations
as may occur to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="negro-resentment">Negro Resentment</h2>
<p>The Council reported that it was pleased with the report of these
race leaders, hut that it could find no fault with the past work of the
federation. It agreed that with cooperation of these leaders it could do
much better in the future. No further action was taken upon the
proposition. Whereas the 1918 convention had appeared <span
class="pagenum">907</span> to portend fundamental changes of moment to
negro workers, the procrastination which ensued thenceforth was a
disillusionment, The less conservative negro. leadership spoke
embitteredly; and W. E. B. Du Bois, editor of <em>The Crisis</em>,
commented: “The recent [1918] convention of the American Federation of
Labor at Buffalo is no proof of a change of heart. Grudgingly,
unwillingly, almost insultingly, this federation yields to us inch by
inch the status of half a man, denying and withholding every privilege
it dares at all times.” Agitation of this sort had been persistenly
waged by Mr. Du Bois through <em>The Crisis</em>, the official organ of
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.</p>
<p>A more positive approach toward solving the problem was agreed upon
at the association’s 1924 convention. The association issued a proposal
to the American Federation of Labor for beginning an intensive campaign
of organization among negro workers and for the education of white and
black workers as to their community of economic interests. Similarly,
the National Urban League for Social Service Among Negroes has very
recently created a Department of Industrial Relations, one of whose
functions is to engender sympathetic racial attitudes among white and
black workers. President Green has promised cooperation from the
Executive Council of the federation. And, in New York City, a trade
union council has been formed, with the services of a paid worker, who
is to promote more amiable race relations in the trade unions and direct
trade union affiliation among negro workers.</p>
<p>A more militant and radical determination to break down race and
color psychology in the ranks of American labor was expressed by the
Fourth Congress of the Third Internationale in Moscow in 1922. The
Congress resolved that “the international struggle of the negro race is
a struggle against capitalism and imperialism” and that “the Communist
International is not simply the organization of the enslaved white
workers of Europe and America, but equally the organization of the
oppressed colored peoples of the world.” It further resolved to “fight
for race equality of the negro with the white people, as well as for
equal wages and political and social rights”; to “use every instrument
within its control to compel the trade unions to admit negroes”; and to
“take immediate steps to hold a general negro conference or congress in
Moscow.”</p>
<p>The American Negro Labor Congress, organized in Chicago, Oct. 25-31,
1925, is partial fruition of the Communists’ avowal to organize the
American negro into a revolutionary working-class movement. The
congress, though not actually known to have been backed by Soviet money,
was openly sponsored by the Workers’ Party of America. Nevertheless the
demands of the Labor Congress, which struck at certain restraints and
repressions that social circumstance has placed upon the negro, can
hardly be labeled as revolutionary or even as ultra-militant utterances.
From another point of view the congress manifested decided radicalism.
Attributing race prejudice to modern capitalism, it pronounced this
indictment: “Intent upon holding down the workers of all races as a
general lower class, our masters wish to make us a general lower class
within a lower class. The white worker must be made to realize that this
discrimination against the negro worker comes back against him
ultimately.” The criticism leveled at the American Federation was no
less scathing: “The failure of the American Federation of Labor
officialism, under pressure of race prejudice benefiting only the
capitalists of the North and South, to stamp out race hatred in the
unions, to organize negro workers, and to build a solid front of the
workers of both races against American capitalism, is a crime against
the whole working class. If the unions of the American Federation of
Labor, through ignorance and prejudice, fail in this duty to the
American workers and continue a policy of exclusion in the face of the
influx of negro workers into industry, we negro workers must organize
our own unions as a powerful weapon with which to fight our way into the
existing labor movement on a basis of full equality.”</p>
<h2 id="radical-appeal-to-negroes">Radical Appeal to Negroes</h2>
<p>The American Negro Labor Congress appears to be fundamentally a
revolt against color psychology in the American labor movement and,
incidentally, a pro<span class="pagenum">908</span>test against
iniquities arising from the race distinctions perpetuated in American
institutions. Like most of us, the negro Communists believe that the
insecurity of job and the inadequacy of income are bound up inextricably
with the negro’s problems of housing, health and cultural development.
But, unlike some of us, they believe that nothing short of a new social
order can relieve the negro of such social handicaps. Furthermore, the
inability of the negro wage earners to better their economic status
through collective bargaining because of the barriers set up by various
unions against negro membership; a belief in the alleged conspiracy
between white employers and their employees to keep negro workers out of
certain occupations; a growing disquietude among the negro masses over
the conciliatory character of some of the existing negro organizations
whose progress in race relations provokes doubtful concern; and a
general dissatisfaction with the restraints placed upon the negro by
American race sentiment, are factors which furnish a field of inviting
fertility to propaganda which promises a world where economic and social
equality prevails.</p>
<p>Perhaps most of the rank and file of the American Negro Labor
Congress was wholly unacquainted with Marxian economics and the recent
Leninized version of it. Nor, perhaps, is this rank and file gravely
concerned with any proposed reorganization of modern industrial society.
Yet the Communist Party’s appeals to it may meet a sympathetic response
in spite of its impotence to secure any immediate economic good for the
negro or, for that matter, any immediate good either for the negro or
for the white worker. But when a promise of racial equality, which,
although as a rule of secular conduct, has to await realization in a
future world, is reinforced by observance of equality in social
practice, as is done in the Workers’ Party, it must have a tremendous
appeal to a disadvantaged group such as the negro. And the success of
economic radicalism is contingent upon the capacity of the conservative
working class forces to effect a counter-reformation.</p>
<p>The American Negro Labor Congress’ resolve to organize negroes into
their own labor unions has been anticipated by the Pullman porters.
Several attempts have been made to organize the negro sleeping and
dining car employees into a national union. The dining car employees
were successfully organized on several railway lines. But all attempts
to organize the sleeping car employees were futile. The present
organization of porters, who are being led by A. Philip Randolph, editor
of The Messenger, seems assured of success. It is estimated that 60 per
cent, of the porters employed by the Pullman Company are in the
organization. When completed the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Employees
will approximate a total membership of at least 10,000.</p>
<p>A decade and a half ago the most serious problem facing the negro
masses as they surged cityward was securing industrial opportunity.
Today, although numerous restrictions exist in many localities against
the negro’s entrance into the higher skilled occupations, his problem is
ceasing to be “securing the right to work.” More and more it is becoming
“organizing so as to counteract the weaknesses of the individual wage
earner in industrial society.” The whole cultural, intellectual and
social life of the negro, like that of other groups, is dwarfed to the
degree that life in the lower stratum is economically secure. These
working-class movements among the negroes are therefore pregnant with
significance to him and the society of which he is a part—this, whether
the movements are radical or conservative; whether they are erected
within the American Federation of Labor or outside of its
jurisdiction.</p>
