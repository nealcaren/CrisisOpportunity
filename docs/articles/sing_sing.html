<p><span class="pagenum">215</span>Sing Sing prison is located thirty
miles up the east bank of the Hudson River from New York City; beneath a
high bluff, where more than three hundred years ago the Sinck Sinck
Indians built their signal fires. Originally called the Mount Pleasant
Prison, it is historically the third of New York’s state prisons. The
Sing Sing cell block, built entirely by prisoners, was completed in
1828. Because the inmates are committed from the counties of New York
State which average one-twentieth of the United States’ population, Sing
Sing — as far as the racial and nationality composition of its
population is concerned — may be truly called the most representative of
American prisons.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite the fact that more than twenty-five hundred Negroes have been
committed to Sing Sing since 1920, they have always been an integral
part of the prison’s population. One hundred and two years ago they
formed 23 per cent of the prison population. In 1931 Negro admissions
were 23.9 per cent of the total, the highest ratio they have ever shown.
If Negroes were present in Sing Sing in the same ratio at which they are
found in the total population of southern New York State, 2,500 (the
number of black admissions between 1920 and 1931) would be about
550.</p>

<p>A significant fact obtainable from an analysis of commitments to Sing
Sing is that criminal activity is not the monopoly of any racial or
nationality group. Nevertheless, it is true that in every main group of
crimes, but especially in assault, homicide and burglary, Negroes exceed
the numbers which might be expected from their rank in the population of
this district. In an analysis of 5,000 men committed to Sing Sing during
the period 1923-1927, 4,097 were whites, 895 were Negroes and 8 were
Orientals. Warden Lawes’ analysis of the crimes for which these
prisoners were committed showed that 65 per cent of those committed for
robbery were of Italian, English and Irish stock; 62 per cent of those
committed for larceny were of Jewish, English and German stocks; and 76
per cent of those committed for assault and 74 per cent for homicide
wrere of Negro, Italian and Irish stocks.<a href="#fn2"

<p>Negroes admitted to Sing Sing during this period had four times their
population expectancy in commitments for robbery, larceny and sexual
offenses; eight times for burglary; nine times for homicide and eleven
times for assault.</p>
<p>No valid deductions may be made from the statistical data given until
due allowance is made for other physical, social and economic factors
which represent the total situation. Thus, the Warden’s “practical
pictures” of types of crimes in which Negroes show a high frequency of
commitments illustrate general types that are summarized in the
following patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Burglary:</strong> The chief offenders are native-born
Negroes; foreign-born of Jewish stock, or United States born of Irish
stock; between twenty-two and twenty-six years of age; intermediate
grade education; dull mentality and below par physically; may be
psychopathic or drug addict; menial employment; indolent and unwilling
to work; likely to be second offender.</li>
<li><strong>Assault:</strong> The chief offenders are—native-born
Negroes, foreign-born Italians and United States-born of Irish stock;
between twenty-two and twenty-six years of age; comparatively
illiterate; dull or psychopathic mentally and superior physically;
common labor; willing to work but slow’; first offender.</li>
<li><strong>Homicide:</strong> The chief offenders are white,
foreign-born Italians, native-born Negroes, United States born of Irish
stock; between twenty-seven and thirty-one years of age; comparatively
illiterate; unstable and paranoiac mentally; normal physically; good
worker; first offender.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>On April 1, 1930, there were 2,481 inmates in Sing Sing of whom 563
or 22.68 per cent were Negroes. The average age of these Negro inmates
at the time of conviction was 28 years, 8 months and 13 days.</p>
<p>Robbery, assault, burglary and larceny were the chief offenses for
which these 563 Negroes were committed. The present Sing Sing Negro
population exceeds its population expectancy of four per cent in all
crimes save rape, sodomy, forgery and miscellaneous offenses.</p>

<p>In Sing Sing’s resident Negro population there are 5 awaiting
execution for murder, 19 serving terms of twenty or more years to life,
9 serving life sentences, 2 serving sentences commuted from execution to
life, 44 serving indeterminate sentences of a minimum of fifteen or more
years and 35 serving determinate sentences of fifteen or more years.</p>
<p>There are more foreign-born Negroes in Sing Sing’s population today
than ever before. In 1929, 19 or 7.8 per cent of the total Negro
admissions were foreign-born. In 1930, foreign-born Negroes admitted
numbered 27 or 11.4 per cent of the total Negro admissions. The number
reached a new high, of 45 or 13.5 per cent of all Negro admissions in
1931.</p>
<p>A rather detailed analysis of the factors attending the commitment of
80 Negroes to Sing Sing Prison during 1930 disclosed that among Negroes,
as among other races, broken homes, poverty, bad social and leisure
habits, lack of intelligent and sympathetic guidance, unemployment and
the shifting of jobs with more unemployment very definitely affected
each of the cases studied.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The analyst in this study endeavored to list the circumstances
present at the time the crime was committed. These appeared as

<p>In these days of industrial depression, more so than normally, being
out of work undoubtedly has a very direct and common relationship with
crime. In the 47 cases of unemployment covered in this study it is
difficult to conclude that “being out of work” with the implication of
“being out of money” was a cause. The fact of the matter appears to be
that unemployment leaves the individual in idleness — with time to
contact chronic idlers, to seek any amusement and excitement to avoid
ennui or thought of future consequences, if he does not find work. These
factors, plus the fact that the Negro worker lives so near the fringe of
marginal existence that there is seldom any money surplus, are
outstanding aspects of this situation.</p>
<p>Bad social and leisure habits show a high frequency. Long before
hunger drives the offender into predatory acts, other social factors
have entered the picture. Social emulation, improvident expenditure of
leisure, commercialized vice, leisure-class dictates — all have provided
a much more dangerous and sordid motive for crimes against property in
particular than simple hunger.</p>
<p>Drinking was a factor in only eight of the 80 cases studied, the
greatest association being found linked with crimes against the
person.</p>
<p>Emotionalism was found to be a direct factor in crimes committed
against the person. This factor is difficult to define, but refers to
situations in which the individual has shown loss of ’emotional
perspective and has disregarded his own immediate interest, as well as
the remote consequences of the act, and under conditions in which there
could be no predatory interest or trend.</p>
<p>Those chance circumstances which would augment the probability of a
crime’s occurrence in a weak or highly suggestible individual, while
their absence would perhaps decrease the probability, are classed as
circumstantial factors. These factors did not appear in more than 4 per
cent of the cases studied.</p>
<p>Gangs, as a factor in the crimes of Sing Sing’s Negro prisoners,
operated in only four instances. It might be noted in this connection
that 31 of 67 Negro offenders worked with Negro accomplices. Eighteen of
the men and their Negro accomplices are known to be in Sing Sing, as are
two white, one Mexican and one other accomplice whose race is not
known.</p>
<p>While it cannot be said that any one factor is responsible for the
present social status of the Sing Sing Negro offenders, it is true that
a thorough examination of all factors bearing on the offense and of all
traits and conditions relating to the situation shows a multiplicity of
causations that find their roots deep in the social status of a minority
population.</p>
<p>The presence of an unusual large Negro population in Sing Sing,
therefore, finds its genesis in a sufficiently large number of other
factors to invalidate the opinion that high rates of crime and
incarceration are due to an inherent racial criminality. Such evidence
as there is indicates that social status, political status, and economic
and environmental influences are strong factors. One white student of
the subject concludes that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is little comfort for the native white American in casting the
blame for crime on the Negro. Even if they are more criminal — which is
open to doubt — the causes lie in the social structure for which the
white American is primarily responsible.<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our specific knowledge of the correlation between these factors and
crime, particularly in the impersonal metropolitan centers, is limited.
Ere we can stem this rising tide of color in Sing Sing, some very
definite improvements in community life must be undertaken; these to be
based upon “continuous scientific and unprejudiced accumulation and
interpretation of facts, and their application in the building up of
programs of social improvement.”<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
