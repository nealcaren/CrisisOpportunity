<p>Numerous attempts have been made to describe the policies reflected
by the programs of various thinking groups of Negroes bent upon
lessening the strife occasioned by the vexations circumstances of race
in this country. It will be recognized from a most cursory glance at the
present status of Negro intellectual attainment that fast lines of
cleavage cannot be drawn, demarcating this Negro or that group of
Negroes as whole-hearted subscribers to a single and specific philosophy
of race relations. Obviously as intelligence increases, criticism of
programs and methods sponsored by different leaders becomes more
searching. In discussions by serious-minded young Negroes on the various
types of leadership among the race one ofttimes hears it remarked. “Most
all of these philosophies contain some truth; none of them contains all
the truth on the subject.”</p>
<p>The Negro preacher as a leader has always occupied the most
influential position in the group life of the Negro. Looked upon as a
messenger from a mysterious and supersensuous realm, in possession of an
equally mysterious balm for all ills—political, economic, public and
domestic— he has been both a dispenser of the “ heavenly mann ” and
adviser in secular affairs. But other leaders have also arisen. In
extremely rare instances a new leader may attack religious leadership,
but generally the former has maintained its influence in Negro life
either by paying homage to the religious group or keeping quiet oil the
subject.</p>
<p>The few outspoken political leaders had no remedy for the Negro’s
ills other than the platform of the Republican Party. The period which
followed the Civil War was one in which the doctrine of the ”
indefeasible worth of the downmost man ” was renascent. Living in such a
lime, the shibboleth of the Negro politician as spokesman for four
million recently emancipated slaves was “Equality under the law, assured
by equal suffrage rights.” The nearest approach, however, to a
philosophy on race relations at this time was expressed by Frederick
Douglass in “assimilation through self-assertion.” To some persons this
expression connoted force and emphasized internecine struggle, and this
group was looked upon as a dangerous element, possibly radical. But as
far as deliberately formed organizations and well-thought-out methods
were concerned, the politician’s radicalism was inarticulate and
ineffective. In the absence of a crystallization of tenets so essential
to creating a school of thought, the political aspirant cannot be said
to have evolved a race philosophy or embraced a specific school of
thought on race relations.</p>
<p>The first organized attempt to raise the Negro’s social status was by
Northern Edu<span class="pagenum">411</span>cators, who founded
institutions of learning in the South for the education of the Negro.
One such school was Hampton Institute in Virginia. It was here that the
doctrine of industrial education was born. The founder of Hampton.
General S. C. Armstrong, maintained that “the Negro race will succeed or
fail as it shall devote itself with energy to agriculture and mechanic
arts or avoid these pursuits; and its teachers must be inspired with the
spirit of hard work and acquainted with the ways that lead to material
success.” Booker T. Washington, while a student at Hampton, thoroughly
absorbed this doctrine. After graduating from Hampton he gave impetus to
and broadcast the industrial efficiency idea of Hampton as absolutely
essential to harmonious interracial contact by founding Tuskegee
Institute in Alabama.</p>
<h2 id="booker-washingtons-gospel">Booker Washington’s Gospel</h2>
<p>Booker Washington believed the South to be the section in which the
Negro could best actualize his greatest potentialities. Recognizing the
psychology of the section in which he lived to be inimical to higher
education for his race, and at the same time desirous of lifting his
black fellows with the financial support which he believed Northern
philanthropists would give, he sought to reconcile all groups by
founding his program on immediate expediency. In his celebrated Atlanta
speech Booker Washington maintained that, “ignorant and inexperienced,
it is not strange that in the first years of our new life we began at
the top instead of the bottom; that a seat in Congress or the Slate
Legislature was more sought than real estate or industrial skill; that
the political convention or stump speaking had more attractions than
starting a dairy farm or truck garden.” To those who believed and
advocated the policy of emigration he admonished, “Cast down your bucket
where you are—cast it down by making friends in every manly way of the
people of all races by whom you are surrounded. Cast it down in
agriculture, mechanics, in commerce, in domestic service and in the
professions.” On general racial contacts he held that “in all things
that are purely social we can be as separate as the fingers, yet one as
the hand in all things essential to mutual progress.” This speech,
delivered at the Atlanta Exposition, where representatives of the white
South, the white North and the Negro race were assembled, gave wide
currency to his conciliatory program and Booker Washington was at once
hailed the “pacificator of race relations,” <span
class="pagenum">412</span> the “compromiser between Northern and
Southern whites and the Negro.” Although the speech made for him a
well-nigh invulnerable position in interracial matters, a few Negroes
looked upon it as a repudiation of the race’s political and civil
rights, but only a few had the courage of their convictions.</p>
<p>The first person to open fire upon the Washington group was W.E.B. Du
Bois, a Harvard Doctor of Philosophy, who was leaching at Atlanta
University about this time. Dr. Du Bois branded the speech as “The
Atlanta Compromise,” and criticised it in the following, terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The growing spirit of kindliness and reconciliation between the North
and South after the frightful differences of a generation ago ought to
lie a source of deep congratulation to all and especially to those whose
mistreatment caused the war, but if that reconciliation is to be marked
by the industrial slavery and civic death of those same black men, with
permanent legislation into a position of inferiority, then those black
men, if they are really men, are called upon by every consideration of
patriotism and loyally to oppose such a course by all civilized methods,
even though such opposition involves disagreement with Mr. Booker T.
Washington. …</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the history of nearly all other races and peoples the doctrine
preached at such crises has been that manly self respect is worth more
than lands and houses, and that a people who voluntarily surrender such
respect or cease striving for it arc not worth civilizing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Continuing his criticism of Booker Washington, Dr. Du Bois
argued:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>He is striving nobly to make Negro artisans, business men and
properly owners, but it is utterly impossible under competitive methods
for workingmen and property owners to defend their rights and exist
without the right of suffrage.</li>
<li>He insists on thrift and self-respect, but at the same time counsels
a silent submission to civic inferiority, such as is bound to sap the
manhood of any race in the long run.</li>
<li>He advocates common school and industrial training and depreciates
institutions of higher learning, but neither the Negro common school,
nor Tuskegee itself could remain open a day were it not for the teachers
trained in the Negro colleges or trained by their graduates.</li>
</ol>
<p>There were others who shared Dr. Du Bois’s opinion, but had remained
silent in view of the tremendous odds against them. Later, while
delivering a speech in Boston, Booker Washington was interrupted during
his speech by a question from William Monroe Trotter, a Harvard graduate
and editor of The <em>Boston Guardian</em>, a Negro weekly.
Mr. Trotter’s interruption caused up little confusion and resulted in
his being jailed. Although in Atlanta at the time and having no part in
the incident, Dr. Du Bois fell that, while it was not customary to
interrogate speakers from the floor as Mr. Trotter had done, the latter
had committed no crime for which he should be jailed. Consequently be
spoke in no uncertain language in Mr. Trotter’s behalf. These incidents
formed the matrix from which issued an organization opposing the
Tuskegee doctrine.</p>
<p>In July, 1905, a conference of twenty-nine colored men assembled at
the request of Dr. Du Bois at the Erie beach Hotel, Fort Erie, Ontario,
and formed what was soon known as the Niagara Movement. Among the aims
of the new movement were:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Freedom of speech and criticism;</li>
<li>Manhood suffrage;</li>
<li>The abolition of all caste distinction based simply upon race and
color;</li>
<li>The recognition of the principles of hitman brotherhood as a
practical present creed; and</li>
<li>The recognition of the highest and best human training as the
monopoly of no class or race.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Niagara Movement never attained a very large membership. After
four years of protests and battling in the courts for civil rights, most
of its members went over to the newly formed National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People.</p>
<p>The program of the National Association was formulated to fight civil
injustices through the courts. Dr. Du Bois became chief spokesman for
the new organization and editor of its official organ, <em>The
Crisis</em>. In this connection it should not be forgotten that Dr. Du
Bois was already author of “The Souls of Black Folk,” “The Atlanta
University Public<span class="pagenum">413</span>ations,” “The
Philadelphia Negro” and “The Quest of the Silver Fleece.” His latest
book is “Dark Water.” As editor of <em>The Crisis</em>, Dr, Du Bois is
scathing, yet admittedly brilliant and scholarly in his attacks upon the
race situation in this country. Maintaining that “the Negro does not
want to marry a woman of any other race or a woman may not want to marry
this black man or this red man or this white … but the impudent and
vicious demand that all colored folk shall write themselves down as
brutes by a general assertion of their unfitness to marry other decent
folk is a nightmare,” Dr. Du Bois at once became the recognized leader
of the radical Negro.</p>
<p>With the passing of a few years the N.A.A.C.P. is seen in its most
dramatic Supreme Court fight, which resulted in the removal of the
segregation ordinances from the statute books of Southern cities. The
organization soon gathered within its folds such young men as James
Weldon Johnson, a noted writer and a graduate of Cornell University and
Columbia Law <span class="pagenum">414</span> School: William Pickens, a
Yale graduate and former Dean of Morgan College; Walter White, a
Bachelor of Arts of Atlanta University, and Robert Bugnall, a former
Episcopal clergyman. Thus, with the coming of the Niagara movement and
Dr. Du Bois, we have the genesis of the militant Negro and with the
birth of the N.A.A.C.P. the spirit of the Niagara movement and its
passionate ardor for civil rights perpetuated among us. Booker
Washington’s philosophy of conciliation still lives in his successor,
Major Robert R. Moton, also a graduate of Hampton Institute, as is
evident from the latter’s recent “good-will” tour through the South.</p>
<p>A direct adjunct of the Tuskegee philosophy is that school of thought
embraced by Dr. George E. Haynes, a former Professor of Economics at
Fisk University, Nashville, Tenn., and at present Secretary, Interracial
Committee, the Federal Council of Churches of America. Dr. Haynes’s
philosophy, while not advocating the industrial efficiency idea of
Tuskegee, does accept its pacifism. In his book, “The Trend of the
Races,” he submits that the only solution to the question of race in
America is the application of “good-will” and the “ Gospel of Christ” to
the problem. The recognized proselytes of this doctrine are limited in
number among the Negro race. For generally Negroes inveigh against a
system which makes invidious distinctions between Christian doctrine and
Christian practice in every-day contacts. Yet Dr. Haynes has a large
audience among the white race, particularly members of the interracial
bodies of the South.</p>
<h2 id="negro-marxians">Negro Marxians</h2>
<p>The intrepidity evinced by the philippies of Dr. Du Bois paved the
way for even more daring attacks by certain young Negroes just leaving
the colleges (as late as 1915). The rise of this new group of militants,
led by Chandler Owen and A. Philip Randolph, soon eclipsed the former
radicalism of the editor of <em>The Crisis</em>. Through their magazine,
the <em>Messenger</em>, described as “a journal of scientific
radicalism,” these young men proclaimed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Civil liberty in the United States is dead. Any true reconstruction
program must deal with its</p>
</blockquote>
<p>resuscitation and reintroduction into American life. Civil liberty
for the Negro, however, was dead even before the war, killed by the
combination of a hypocritical North and an unregenerate South who
colluded to sweep from the Negro his last vestige of liberty. We
repudiate and condemn any pretense at opposition to Jim Crowism,
segregation and all forms of discrimination which does not accept the
principle of social equality, since it is upon the fallacious theory of
inequality and racial inferiority that all these evils are established
and continued. We do not accept the doctrine of old, reactionary Negroes
that the Negro is satisfied to be to himself. We desire as much contact
and intercourse-social, economic and political—as is possible between
the races. This is not because of our belief in the inferiority or
superiority of either race, but because of our recognition that the
principle of social equality is the only sure guarantee of social
progress—the inevitable trend of evolution.</p>
<p>Not only did the <em>Messenger</em> editors champion the doctrine of
unlimited equality of the Du Bois school, but sought to make.it a
reality by urging the unionization of white and black workers in trade
unions on an equal basis of admission. Messrs. Randolph and Owen soon
became instructors of Marxian Socialism in the Rand School of Social
Science in New York. To their contemporary opponents they became
wild-eyed “Reds” of the deepest dye. During the war, the Lusk Committee
informed the Department of Justice that the <em>Messenger</em> magazine
was “by far the most dangerous of all Negro publications.”</p>
<p>Despite the hostility roused within the Negro group against them,
Messrs. Randolph and Owen have a following which comprises some of the
best trained minds in the race. Some of these are to be found in the
Northern and Southern universities. It goes without saying that the bulk
of their following is in labor and Socialist circles. White liberals and
radicals for the most part are better acquainted with the
<em>Messenger</em> than are most Negroes. Mrs. Mary White Ovington, a
white writer of considerable prominence, once said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to express to you my pleasure at the publication of a
magazine, edited by colored men, that makes as its cornerstone the
solidarity of labor and the absolute need of the Negro’s recognizing
this solidarity. As a Socialist of many years’ standing I have looked
closely at the young <span class="pagenum">415</span> colored men and
women graduates from our colleges, hoping to find some of them imbued
with the revolutionary spirit. I have found a few, and I have been
especially happy to see here in New York two good Socialists of college
training who are giving up their life lo the spread of Socialist
thought.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is claimed in some circles that <em>The Messenger</em> editors
have receded from their ultra-radical and Socialist position. Whether
this he true or false, it is evident that <em>The Messenger</em> still
sways the militant Left Wing. Speaking of the proposed “monument to
black mammies,” it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We favor the erection of a monument to the Negroes of Washington,
Chicago, Longview, Texas; Knoxville, Tenn.; Tulsa, Okla., and
Philadelphia who rose in their might and said to the authorities, “If
you cannot protect us, we will protect ourselves; if you cannot uphold
the law, we will maintain constituted authority. … Let its while shaft
point like a lofty</p>
</blockquote>
<p>mountain peak to a New Negro Mother, no longer a “white man’s woman,”
no longer the sex-enslaved “ black mammy” of Dixie, but the apotheosis
of triumphant Negro womanhood.</p>
<h2 id="the-national-urban-league">The National Urban League</h2>
<p>Although organized in 1910 as a means of effecting harmonious
interracial contact through social uplift, the National Urban League was
not recognized as a potent factor in the equation of race relations
until the recent exodus of Negroes from the South. During this period it
placed over 1150,000 male and female colored workers in positions
throughout the Northern industrial centres. Eugene Kinckle Jones, a
graduate of Virginia Union University and an M.A. of Cornell University,
is Executive Secretary of the organization. The Board of Directors
comprises men and women of both races who represent capitalists,
Socialists, radicals and conservatives, but have as their <span
class="pagenum">416</span> common fundamental purpose “the bettering of
interracial relationship by raising the economic, educational, health
and recreational phases of Negro life.” The organization is supported in
the main by while philanthropy. Its policy is put into operation by
forty or more locals scattered over the country mainly in the industrial
centres. These locals are administered for the most part by college
graduates and in every case by trained social workers. Recently the
Urban League issued from its national offices in New York a monthly
magazine, <em>Opportunity</em>, under the editorship of Charles S.
Johnson, a graduate of Virginia Union and Chicago Universities, a
Secretary of the Chicago Race Commission and chief editor of <em>The
Negro in Chicago</em>. The magazine gives a monthly account of the
striving of Negroes and their social handicaps, and expresses with force
and ability the motto of the National Urban League—“ Not Alms, but
Opportunity”</p>
<p>The debacle of 1918 was just over. Oppressed people the world over
were thinking in terms of the newly promulgated “self-determination for
smaller nationalities.” “Backwack peoples” were in hysteria, each urged
onward by an easily stimulated nationalistic psychology to the
realization of this ideal, “autonomy.” Such was the case with Poles,
Slovaks, Irish and Indians, but not to any great extent among American
and foreign born Negroes. It was left for Marcus Garvey, a Negro of
foreign birth, to fan such dormant passions of the Negro into a
conflagration exceeding his greatest hopes. Starting as he did with a
program which planned to develop commercial enterprise between the West
Indies, Africa and America, Garvey soon realized that some bizarre
appendage to his movement would give it magnetism. Thus a “Back to
Africa” propaganda was begun. The Black Star Line was created; old ships
were purchased, and then came revenue and members. To give publicity to
his program, Mr. Garvey established a paper, <em>The Negro World</em>,
and later a daily, <em>The Negro Times</em>. He gathered about him such
men as William Ferris, a Harvard graduate; Eric Waldron, one of the
younger writers, and Hubert Harrison, a noted writer and lecturer. That
most of these men had little sympathy with the grandiose African scheme
is evidenced by the fact that they were all highly paid or given
promises of large salaries. Generally, persons in sympathy with the
idealism of a young movement arc willing to make some financial
sacrifices for its ultimate triumph. Not so with the highly paid
officials of the Garvey movement, as the recent lawsuits attest.</p>
<h2 id="garvey-not-a-radical">Garvey Not a Radical</h2>
<p>By public acclamation the Garvey movement was termed the most radical
that had ever made its appearance among the Negroes. Yet the student of
social affairs, asked how could this Negro preach a radical doctrine
when while radicals were being imprisoned and deported? That Garvey was
not a radical in any sense of the word, but a reactionary, is attested
by his utterances and the fact that he was tolerated. The difference
between Garvey and the real radicals is that he did not plan the
destruction of a Government in America, but the construction of one in
Africa. It is true that he advocated the emigration of Negroes to Africa
which would sorely menace the labor supply of the Southern Slates, but
did he not also preach with one and the same breath that this is a while
man’s country? The Universal Negro Improvement Association lost its
original commercial aspect. The Black Star Line, the Back to Africa
scheme, which was the proverbial “side show,” had gobbled up the circus!
Soon this was suspended. Garvey made another grandstand play. He
bargains with the Ku Klux Klan and champions their right to make America
safe for white supremacy just as he was making Africa safe for black
supremacy. As for Jim Crowism in public conveyances, he maintains, that
it serves the Negro justly, since the railroads were not built by
Negroes but by white Americans. Let the Negro migrate to Africa, where
he can build them for himself and, incidentally, Jim Chow white man if
need be.</p>
<p>Litigation after litigation, financial difficulty one after another,
the bankruptcy of stores and the Black Star Line did not shake the faith
of his naive followers. <span class="pagenum">417</span> The Garvey
movement found no response in the “good livers” among the Negroes, for,
despite obvious racial handicaps, they rejoice in being products of
centuries of American acculturation. They could boast of some education
and of having acquired property. They were lighting for civil and social
recognition as American citizens and were little concerned with an
African empire. Not so with the bulk of Garvey’s followers. The typical
Garveyite had neither education nor property, was scorned by the world
of whites and looked upon with condescension by his black brother of the
higher social level—literally. the “scum of the earth,” a worker of
meagre earnings, a forlorn and dejected pariah.</p>
<p>Naturally, any world, real or imaginary, in which such an individual
could be a “somebody,” had the highest charms for him and was considered
worth boosting, whether attainable or no. Thus, a world of logic could
not impress the impracticability of this scheme upon one of this type.
On the contrary, he would go into fits of convulsive vituperation and
cling more tenaciously to his fetich, despite its flagrant
valuelessness. It matters not that European powers have partitioned
Africa; he wants to believe in this African mirage in spite of stern
realities. He does not want to be disillusioned; for did not his
President-General say that he would tell England, France and the other
nations to get out of Africa? It is said that if one repeats a thing to
himself often enough he will soon come to believe it to be true, no
matter how utterly false. This seems to be the case with Garvey, whom
Judge Panken of New York pronounced a paranoiac preying upon the
gullibility of ignorant Negroes.</p>
<p>After the last presidential campaign, internal disputes arose in the
Socialist Party over allegiance to the Communist International and the
policy of direct or indirect action. The discussion resulted in a split
and the formation of the Workers’ Party of America, which accepted the
“twenty-one points” issued from Moscow. Negroes, particularly of New
York, were in this also. The African Blood Brotherhood affiliated with
the Workers’ Party, and under the leadership of Cyril Briggs, is alleged
to be the official communist organization among the Negroes. Claude
McKay, the poet, and a former member of <em>The Liberator</em> staff, is
also connected with this group. The Communist element makes its
appearance as the latest development in racial leadership. At present
its following is quite small and its voice is hardly heard outside New
York City.</p>
<p>Those who wish to become conversant with the intellectual
cross-currents in the <span class="pagenum">418</span> life of the Negro
must not investigate factional leadership only. There are Negro men and
women with whom skin pigmentation and racial identity are purely
incidental. They should he looked upon as Negroes who are intellectuals,
rather than as Negro intellectuals. Even in some of the organizations
that have been mentioned are found quite a number of persons who are not
subscribers to race philosophy. In view of this and their training as
well as their cultural associations and artistic propensities, they
should be placed in the intellectual category. Typical among them are
Dr. Alain Locke, professor of philosophy at Howard University,
Washington. D.C., and winner of a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford; Miss
Jessie Fauset, an A.B. of Cornell University and Master of Arts of the
University of Pennsylvania. (Miss Fauset studied in France for a season
and is at present literary editor of <em>The Crisis</em>); Dr. W.A.
Scarborough, president-emeritus of Wilberforce University, a Greek
scholar and author; Arthur Schomberg, noted linguist and member of the
American Negro Academy; William Stanley Braithwaite, poet and literary
critic; Dr. Archibald Grimke, writer and publicist; Miss Frances Grimke,
poetess; Dr. John Hope, President of Moorehouse College. Atlanta, Ga.,
and J. Milton Sampson, former professor of French and German at Virginia
Union University, Richmond, Va., and at present Director of the
Department of Research, National Urban League, Chicago, Ili. Others who
might he included in this group, despite their affiliation with certain
organizations, are Walter White and Robert Bagnall of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People and Charles Johnson.
National Urban League, New York City.</p>
<p>Professor Kelly Miller of Howard University has hit upon a grand
get-together project by which he proposes to bind all the Negro groups
into a confederation so that a solid front may be presented in racial
matters. It was last March that the various schools of leadership
assembled in New York at Professor Millers request. Communists,
socialists, liberals, radicals and conservatives and secular and
religious leaders were present at this All Race Conference. The question
has already been asked. ”Does this burying of hatchets for the moment at
which Professor Miller aims, mean the ultimate throttling of that
freedom of political and religious speech and thought—so essential to
progress—which the Negro is just beginning to demonstrate?” What will be
the result one cannot predict at such an early stage.</p>
