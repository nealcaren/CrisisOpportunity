<p><span class="pagenum">54</span>As a rough answer to this question,
the results of written answers of Negro school children and students
have been collected. A series of simple questions were first put to
1,500 Negro school children in the Atlanta public schools. The most of
them were between the ages of 9 and 15 years and were city bred. Of
these 583 said that laws were made “for protection;” 315, “to keep
peace” or “order;” and 183, to “govern” or “rule” persons.</p>
<p>The answers classed under “For protection” include many forms of
protection; <em>e.g.</em>, protection of one’s rights, of property, of
person, protection of city, of state, of country. Under the hundred or
more unclassified answers are many which speak of laws as a means of
preventing fighting, stealing, <em>etc</em>.</p>
<p>Their ideas of courts were correct: “To determine guilt or innocence”
(398); “to see that the laws are obeyed” (222); “to settle matters”
(222); a few say for “bad people” (69). Policemen are for the purpose of
“arresting people” (522), or “protecting” them (840). Policemen are
usually kind to 018 of the little ones, but were considered unkind by
459 and variable by 204. Most of them say that persons are sent to the
“chaingang” for breaking the law and wrong-doing, but some others say
that people are sent to the chaingang because “they haven’t the money to
pay their fines.” One boy says: “Some good people are sent to the
chaingang and some bad ones. They are sent because they are
convicted.”</p>
<p>The students, 534 in number, were older (13 to 21 years of ago) and
come from all parts of the state. Policemen have never helped or
protected most of them (403); and 21 declared they have been
specifically wronged by policemen. Of those who have seen courts in
session (184), 71 think the judge and jurors acted fairly, and 41 that
they did not; <span class="pagenum">55</span>” their opinions of persons
sent to the “chaingang” vary: 164 think them “bad or unfortunate; 54
think they deserve punishment “if guilty,” and 46 doubt the guilt of
many of them; 25 are “sorry for them,” and 22 think their punishment
“makes them worse,” but 28 consider them “a disgrace to their race.” In
general, many students consider that persons who are sent to the
chaingang are very unfortunate. Many say that, while they are in favor
of punishment for law-breakers, they consider the “chaingang” the worst
and poorest means of punishment. These also speak of and deplore the
treatment of the criminals on the “gang.”</p>
<p>Many speak of the very disastrous results upon young criminals and
express the wish that reformation be provided for the youthful offenders
of the law. One says along this line: “The chaingang system is
discreditable. It seems to defeat the purpose of punishment. I grow
indignant over the presence of young boys in the chaingang.” Another
says: “The intermingling of young criminals with old ones in the
chaingang is one of the worst evils of the system.” A third says: “I
think it [the chaingang] is one of the last resorts to which the state
should give itself. The treatment of the men in most cases is very
severe and especially unbearable in the fierce winter months.”</p>
<p>When asked why so many young Negroes get into the clutches of the
law, 152 ascribe it to “indolence” and “laziness;” 62 say for “not
attending to their own business;” 57, “disobedience;” 40 “bad company;”
39, “ignorance;” 67, “lack of home-training;” and 19, “race prejudice.”
Most of them have several causes why so many young colored boys get into
trouble. As an example of this one student says: “Ignorance, prejudice,
poverty, wrong-doing.” Another says: “Idleness is almost solo cause.
Race prejudice also aids, as more Negroes are handled by the courts for
the same offenses than whites.” A third says: “The important causes are,
I think, the lack of moral training, the lack of educational privileges,
and beyond all the lack of good home-training. Another cause is the
difficulty Negro boys have in getting employment.”</p>
<p>As a remedy for criminality among Negroes, 118 say “better
employment;” 112, “education;” 77, “teaching them the right;” 35,
“home-training;” 24, “establishing reformatories;” 22, “Christian work;”
12, “by raising their standards and ideals;” and 10, “by closing places
of evil and vice.” Many suggest fair trial and unprejudiced decision in
courts. Many also speak of good association, while some add that “our
best people should dwell on the disgrace of being confined to the
chaingang.”</p>
