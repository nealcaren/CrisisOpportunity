<p><span class="pagenum">40</span>The last federal census showed the
Negro population of Chicago to be about 35,000. The present population
is estimated to be over 50,000, an increase of about forty per cent in
five years. The colored people who are thus crowding into Chicago come
mostly from the states of Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi,
Louisiana, Arkansas and Missouri.</p>
<p>The underlying causes are easily traceable and are mainly as
follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Primarily to escape laws of race discrimination that have steadily
increased during the last few years.</li>
<li>To obtain better school privileges.</li>
<li>On account of the good news circulated by the hundreds of young
colored men and women who have been educated in the Chicago and
Northwestern Universities and the professional schools, that Chicago
offers the largest liberty to citizens of all colors and languages of
all communities in the North.</li>
<li>Because of the many industrial strikes which in the last ten years
have brought thousands of colored people to Chicago, either for
immediate work as strike breakers, or with the prospect of employment
through the opportunities for both skilled and unskilled* workers.
Whatever the cause, the fact remains that thousands of Negro men and
women are now employed in the stock-yards and other large industrial
plants, where ten years ago this would not have been thought of.</li>
</ol>
<p>This increase of Negro population has brought with it problems that
directly affect the social and economic life of the newcomers. Prevented
from mingling easily and generally with the rest of the city’s
population, according to their needs and deservings, but with no
preparation made for segregation, their life in a great city has been
irregular and shifting, with the result that they have been subject to
more social ills than any other nationality amongst us. Notwithstanding
the disadvantages suggested, the colored people of Chicago have shown in
their efforts for self-help and self-advancement a determination that is
altogether creditable.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> While it is true that they
contribute almost more than their share of the sins of the community,
what they contribute in the way of restraining and correcting influences
over their own lives, is much more important.</p>
<p>The real problem of the social life of the colored people in Chicago,
as in all northern cities, lies in the fact of their segregation. While
they do not occupy all the worst streets and live in all the unsanitary
houses in Chicago, what is known as the “Black Belt” is altogether
forbidding and demoralizing. The huddling together of the good and the
bad, compelling the decent element of the colored people to witness the
brazen display of vice of all kinds in front of their homes and in the
faces of their children, are trying conditions under which to remain
socially clean and respectable. There are some who are all the time
breaking away from these surroundings and by purchase or otherwise are
securing good homes on desirable streets. But the old and unsanitary
shacks from which the good and the thrifty escape are immediately
occupied by others less fortunate. For there are always too few houses
to meet the demands of the newcomers.</p>
<h2 id="the-organizing-faculty-a-racial-passion">The Organizing Faculty
a Racial Passion</h2>
<p>As already suggested the colored people themselves are not
indifferent, to the demoralizing conditions of their environments. The
organizations created and maintained by them in <span
class="pagenum">41</span>Chicago are numerous and touch almost every
phase of our social life.</p>
<p>Is this passion for organization peculiar to Negro people? Whether
this be answered in the affirmative or not, it is a fact that the Negro
individual does not like to be alone in good works. His bent for
organization is a sort of racial passion. Suggest to the average man
something that ought to be, and he immediately proposes an organization.
There is scarcely a thing in religion, in politics, in business, in
pleasure, in education, in fighting race prejudice, or anything else
desirable that is not the object of organization. A catalogue of the
organizations created by colored people in this country would make a
very large book, and would contain an interesting story of the many ways
by which the Negro seeks to improve his condition. It is a common
complaint that the Negroes will not support and protect each other in
any united effort; but this is clearly not so. It is true that more of
these organizations fail than succeed, but the failure is not due to a
lack of the cooperative spirit, which is the most helpful thing in our
race character. The failures are mostly due to a lack of comprehension
and intelligence in working out the details. The weak point is
administration. It is a common thing for men of no training and no
experience to start an organization that requires the highest order of
executive ability to carry out. They will take as a model the
constitution and bylaws of some well-established white organization that
is prominently successful. Officers, directors and committees will be
made up exactly as in the organization which is its model—this, with the
utmost enthusiasm and good faith that their success is assured. The
colored man who ventures to suggest to them that they cannot succeed,
for various and obvious reasons, is at once branded as a “traitor to his
race.” The enterprise may be fore-doomed, but the result will be charged
up to the failure of the people to support and sustain it.</p>
<p>The pathway of our progress is thickly strewn with such failures, but
they do not discourage other and similar attempts. A colored man who has
joined and pinned his faith to an organization that has failed, will
join another society of the same kind to-morrow. It is at once pathetic
and splendid to note how persistent is this faith that emancipation from
the ills of poverty and ignorance and race prejudice is through
co-operation. Indeed, no race of men and women feel more strongly than
we do the force of that maxim that “in union there is strength.”</p>
<h2 id="the-negro-church">The Negro Church</h2>
<p>First in importance is the Negro church. There are 25 regularly
organized colored churches. This number includes 9 Methodist, 8 Baptist,
1 Catholic, 1 Episcopal, 1 Christian and 1 Presbyterian. In addition to
these there are numerous missions in various parts of the “Black Belt.”
These churches are for the most part housed in large and modern stone
and brick edifices that cost from $7,000 to $40,000 each, and have a
seating capacity of from 300 to 2,000 people. Most of these churches are
burdened with oppressive indebtedness, and because of this their
usefulness as agents of moral up-lift is seriously handicapped. For
example, the members of one of the largest have raised and paid in over
$60,000 during the last five years, but the church still carries an
indebtedness of over $24,000.</p>
<p>Despite this serious handicap of a slowly diminishing debt, the
colored church is the center of the social life and efforts of the
people. What the church sanctions and supports is of the first
importance and what it fails to support and sanction is more than apt to
fail. The Negro church historically, as to numbers and reach of
influence and dominion, is the strongest factor in the community life of
the colored people. Aside from the ordinary functions of preaching,
prayer, class meetings and Sunday-school, the church is regarded by the
masses as a sort of tribune of all of their civic and social interests.
Thousands of Negroes know and care for no other entertainment than that
furnished by the church. Theatres, concert halls, and art galleries mean
nothing. What they fail to learn of these things in the churches remains
unlearned. Nearly every night the church building <span
class="pagenum">42</span>is open, either for worship, or for concerts,
lectures, and entertainments of all kinds. Even political meetings of
the most partisan sort, are not barred. The party leaders find it to
their advantage, if they want to secure a large audience of colored
people, to hold their meetings in the colored church. In a purely social
way, the church leads in setting standards of social conduct. Weddings
and receptions of all kinds, except those including dancing, are held
within its walls and in this respect the church has become progressively
liberal. Among other nationalities, there are Young Men’s Christian
Associations, Young Women’s Christian Associations, social clubs,
gymnasiums, reading-rooms, university extension lecture courses, etc.
The colored people, generally speaking, have none of these liberalizing
and elevating influences, except as they are supplied by this single
institution.</p>
<p>Within the last six years, the colored churches of Chicago have begun
to recognize the larger social needs of the people, and as much as their
intense denominationalism will permit, they are endeavoring to enlarge
their influence as a factor for betterment. One of the large churches
has carried on such activities as a kindergarten, a day nursery, a boys’
club and reading-room, a penny savings-bank, gymnasium, a kitchen
garden, mothers’ club and sewing school.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the large churches have literary clubs which have
become attractive to hundreds of young colored men of intelligence. The
effect has been a wider and more intelligent interest in things that
concern the progressive life of the people.</p>
<p>In fine the colored churches must be reckoned with in every movement
of a social character that aims to reach and influence life. They might
do more and be more to the ever-increasing number who need guidance,
social ideals, and higher moral standards, if they were less burdened
with debts and an unyielding orthodoxy. The important thing, however, is
that the Negro church in Chicago is becoming more and more liberal and
intelligently interested and earnest in its endeavors to meet the
peculiar requirements of the city Negro.</p>
<h2 id="the-secret-orders">The Secret Orders</h2>
<p>Next to the Negro church in importance, as affecting the social life
of the people, are the secret orders, embracing such organizations as
the Masons, Odd Fellows, Knights of Pythias, True Reformers, the United
Brotherhood (a fraternal insurance association), the Ancient Order of
Foresters, and the Elks. Nearly all of these secret orders have
auxiliary associations composed of women. The Masons and Odd Fellows are
strongest in point of numbers and influence. There are about fourteen
lodges of Odd Fellows and about as many of Masons. Their estimated
membership is respectively 2,000 and 1,600.</p>
<p>The colored people believe in secret societies. I believe it is safe
to say that fifty per cent of the better class of Negro men are enrolled
in some secret order. These affect every phase of their social life and
represent the best achievements of the race in the matter of
organization. In no other way is the organized Negro so reliably
responsive to the requirements of his social obligations. In no other
form of organization do the terms brotherhood and mutual obligations
mean so much.</p>
<p>Thousands of dollars are paid into the treasuries of these societies
every month, and it is very rare that we hear of any charge of dishonest
dealings in money matters. They take care of the sick and provide for
the dead with a promptness, fidelity and abundance of sympathy that is
not to be found in any other form of society amongst us. The lessons of
right living, of charity and truthfulness are enforced in these
societies more rigidly even than in the churches.</p>
<p>Most of the colored men belong to more than one secret order and many
belong to as many as four or five at a time and live up to their
obligations in all of them. In nothing does the colored man live such a
strenuous life as he does as a lodge man. The lodge, more than any other
merely social organization, is a permanent and ever-increasing
force.</p>
<h2 id="other-organized-activities">Other Organized Activities</h2>
<p>There are other social organizations among the colored people of
Chicago that are indicative of a desire for progress and <span
class="pagenum">43</span>improvement. For example there is one
organization that supports an institution known as the “Old Folks’
Home,” in which some twenty-five old colored men and women are
comfortably cared for and saved from eking out their existence in the
dreaded almshouse.</p>
<p>There is a Choral Study Club composed of about one hundred young men
and women under competent leadership and devoted to the study of music.
A business league, composed of colored business men and women, is a part
of the National Business League of which BooKer T. Washington is founder
and president. A physicians’ club has undertaken a campaign of education
as to the cause of tuberculosis and methods of prevention, together with
lessons on domestic sanitation and kindred subjects.</p>
<p>And there are, of course, numbers of purely pleasure clubs. Love of
pleasure is in good part a hopeful characteristic of the Negro people.
Painfully conscious as we ail are of our present position, which tends
to exclude us from things that are most prized in human relationships,
there is an all-pervading light-heartedness which saves us from the
pessimism that must inevitably banish from the soul all hope and joy.
Young men’s social clubs, young women’s social clubs, fellowship clubs,
whist clubs and social charity clubs fill nights and holidays with
laughter, song and dance.</p>
<h2 id="the-negro-in-his-relations-to-the-dominant-race">The Negro in
His Relations to the Dominant Race</h2>
<p>From what has been said in describing Negro organizations it might be
inferred that the colored people are quite capable of taking care of
themselves and of advancing their own condition in every direction. Let
us be undeceived in this. In every community the Negro is practically
dependent, for nearly everything of importance, upon the dominant race.
He must live in places set apart for him, and that often in the worst
portions of the city. He must find work below his capabilities and
training. He must live on the outer rim of life’s advantages and
pleasures. His merit, whatever it may be, is more apt to be discredited
than recognized. Even though he be educated, public opinion still
persists in rating him as ignorant, and treating him as such.</p>
<p>His virtues are generally overlooked or reluctantly believed in. He
is the victim of more injustice than is meted out to any other class of
people. In the matter of employment, the colored people of Chicago have
lost in the last ten years nearly every occupation of which they once
had almost a monopoly. There is now scarcely a Negro barber left in the
business district. Nearly all the janitor work in the large buildings
has been taken away from them by the Swedes. White men and women as
waiters have supplanted colored men in nearly all the first-class hotels
and restaurants. Practically all the shoe polishing is now done by
Greeks. Negro coachmen and expressmen and teamsters are seldom seen in
the business districts. It scarcely need be stated that colored young
men and women are almost never employed as clerks and bookkeepers in
business establishments. A race that can be systematically deprived of
one occupation after another becomes an easy victim to all kinds of
injustice. When they can be reduced to a position to be pitied, they
will cease to be respected. It is not surprising then that there has
been a marked lowering of that public sentiment that formerly was
liberal and more tolerant of the Negro’s presence and efforts to
rise.</p>
<p>The increase of the Negro population in Chicago, already referred to,
has not tended to liberalize public sentiment; in fact hostile sentiment
has been considerably intensified by the importation from time to time
of colored men as strikebreakers. Then again a marked increase of crime
among the Negro population has been noted in recent years. All these
things have tended to put us in a bad light, resulting in an appreciable
loss of friends and well-wishers.</p>
<h2 id="the-frederick-douglass-center">The Frederick Douglass
Center</h2>
<p>Out of these seemingly hopeless conditions a new movement has grown
that is destined to have an important bearing on the status of the
Chicago Negro. The organization of the Frederick Douglass Center and the
Trinity Mission Settlement are in response to these needs of the hour.
The Frederick Douglass Center is unlike anything of the kind in the
country. It is the outgrowth of a comprehensive study of the situation
by some of the best people of the city of both races. The head <span
class="pagenum">44</span>and soul of the movement, Mrs. Celia Parker
Woolley, is a woman who has given up social pleasures and the pursuits
of culture in behalf of a people and of a problem to grapple with which
requires more than ordinary patience and intelligence.</p>
<p>The Frederick Douglass Center is intended primarily as a center of
influence for the better relationship of the white and colored races
along the higher levels of mutual dependence and helpfulness. The
society is incorporated under the laws of the state of Illinois. Its
by-laws recite its purposes as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>To promote a just and amicable relationship between the white and
colored people.</li>
<li>To remove the disabilities from which the latter suffer in their
civil, political, and industrial life.</li>
<li>To encourage equal opportunity irrespective of race, color, or other
arbitrary distinctions.</li>
<li>To establish a center of friendly helpfulness and influence in which
to gather needful information and for mutual cooperation to the end of
right living and higher citizenship.</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to properly house the movement there has been purchased, at
a cost of $5,500, a large three-story gray-stone house on Wabash avenue,
near Thirty-first street. The location is adjacent to the “Black Belt”
in the rear, and the white belt of aristocracy and wealth on Michigan
avenue in the front. This new home fqr social improvement is fitted up
with an attractive assembly room for meetings, a club-room and workshop
for boys, a reading-room and offices and living-rooms for the head
resident. Arrangements are being made for mothers’ meetings in the
interest of the home, men’s meetings, classes in manual training,
cooking and dressmaking, club work for intellectual and moral culture,
and domestic employment. Lectures are also being provided for under the
departments of sanitation, neighborhood improvement and civics.</p>
<p>Mrs. Woolley has succeeded in interesting in this new work many of
the well-known people of Chicago, judges, lawyers, professors, business
men and women of wealth and culture. Along with these she has the
co-operation of nearly every colored man and woman of standing.</p>
<h2 id="the-trinity-mission">The Trinity Mission</h2>
<p>Another effort toward social betterment is the Trinity Mission. This
is the beginning of a more distinct social settlement. It is located in
the very heart of the “Black Belt” on Eighteenth street between State
and Clark streets, a neighborhood properly called “Darkest Africa.” Here
there is scarcely a single ray of the light of decency. Neither church,
nor school, nor anything else of a helpful character can be found. The
head of this enterprise is a young man, Richard R. Wright, son of
President Wright, of the State Industrial School, at College, Georgia. A
creche, a reading-room and a home for working girls are being carried on
and substantial encouragement has come from people who are in sympathy
with the principle of settlement work.</p>
<p>One of the results of these new organizations is the serious view the
more intelligent colored people are beginning to take of the
responsibilities of city life among their people. The Negro’s worth as a
citizen is to be tested in the great cities of the North as nowhere else
in the world— the use he makes of his opportunities here, and his
strength of character in resisting the malign influences of city
politics.</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The colored people themselves have begun to develop a sort of civic
consciousness as manifested in the tendency of the Negro church and the
Negro lodge to participate more largely in efforts to improve the social
condition of their people.</li>
<li>The men and women who have organized in various ways to bring about
a better Chicago, as well as a larger Chicago, have begun to recognize
that if the ever-increasing Negro population is treated and regarded as
a reprobate race, the result will be an increase of crime and disorders
of all kinds, that will grow more and more difficult to handle and
regulate.</li>
<li>Recent organizations with the settlement spirit are preparing to do
many things in a rational way that have never before been attempted, and
to make answer to many false and harmful things that now go
unchallenged. In other words, by these new movements the Negro is to be
generously included in all efforts to promote civic righteousness among
all the people.</li>
