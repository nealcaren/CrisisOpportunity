<p><span class="pagenum">191</span>Social control, it is generally
admitted among sociologists, is a focal problem of sociology. Yet, to
Herbert Spencer, writing his Principles of Sociology, government was the
center, if not the basis, of social control. Said he:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The earliest kind of government, the most general kind of government,
and the government which is ever spontaneously recommencing, is the
government of ceremonial observances. This kind of government, besides
preceding all other kinds, and besides having in all places and times
approached nearer to universality of influence, has ever had, and
continues to have, the largest share in regulating men’s lives.<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ceremonial observances, he notes, comprises: (1) forms that express
loyalty, respect, and worship, such as, obeisances, prostrations,
bowing, salaams, uncoverings of the head; (2) forms that express
subjection or, in many cases, prestige, such as, the use of titles,
giving or receiving presents, extravagant compliments, exaggerated
eulogies; (3) forms developing from emotional excitement, such as
kissing, embracing, vocal expressions of joy or pleasure; (4) forms “not
originating directly … but by natural sequence rather than intentional
symbolization,” such as making visits, the use of badges and costumes,
and class distinctions that may be exhibited in differences in cut and
quality of clothing, in the shape or ornamentation of houses, and in
methods of transportation.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>William Graham Sumner, seeking controls more informal, and yet more
binding than police, laws, courts, and formal government, has
established the thesis that the <em>mores</em><a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> are
of the former type of controls, and has indicated that etiquette—the
equivalent of Spencer’s “ceremonial government”—is “in the mores.”<a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Students of society, moreover, have shown that ceremonial observances
are not confined to any one social group, but, differing in form and
degree, are universal. They agree, generally, that fundamental patterns
of life and behavior are everywhere the same, and they recognize that
similarities of culture are due to the nature of man, which “is
everywhere essentially the same and tends to express itself in similar
sentiments and institutions.”<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>It has been widely noted that ceremonial observances, generally
deemed proper to the association of white persons and Negroes, exist</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">192</span>in the South. A survey of the
literature of the period prior to the War between the states will
confirm the observation that such observances were formulated into a
code<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> which included, on the one hand
ceremonial forms used by all persons, and on the other, forms resorted
to white persons and Negroes—slave and free—associated. In addition, a
cursory glance into the literature of relations between the races, for
the period since 1865, will give the impression that a code still exists
which, barring some exceptions, is a reminder, if not a heritage, of the
antebellum period.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> It is, however, doubtless true that
small attempt has been made to analyze the etiquette of race relations
from the standpoint of social control.</p>
<p>It might then be profitable to seek to discover: (1) the social
usages or the etiquette<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> customarily employed in social
contacts and relations of white persons and Negroes; (2) how these have
operated to control those relations; and (3) what effect the success or
failure of the control has had upon the ability of the two races to
enter into, and to cooperate in, an effective corporate life. If these
objectives were realized, it might again be profitable to discuss
certain educational implications involved in the question of etiquette
and race relations.</p>
<h2 id="the-code-op-interracial-etiquette">The Code op Interracial
Etiquette</h2>
<p>The Golden Age of etiquette in race relations might with a degree of
accuracy be placed in the period of American Negro slavery. Politeness
on the part of Negroes, especially, was during that period remarked by
more than one traveller and generally attributed to innate
disposition.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Where slaves met white persons
publicly, the men touched or removed their hats—in those cases where
they actually wore hats—or would nod and bow, and women slaves would
curtsy. Shaking hands, regulated by local custom, might or might not be
appropriate, but kissing, especially when indulged in by “Black <span
class="pagenum">193</span> mammy” was not entirely tabooed.<a
href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Masters were addressed as “massa” or “marster”, and mistresses as
“missis” by slaves on the plantations and in the homes, but favorite
slaves were occasionally granted the privilege of addressing the
mistress as “Miss” with the Christian name, or of using “Missy” without
the Christian name. The master’s children were addressed as “Young
Massa” or “Young Miss”, perhaps from the cradle.</p>
<p>“Mistis”, “Madam” or “Captain” and “Boss” were forms widely used by
slaves to address white persons with whom they were not intimately
acquainted, and whom they met publicly. “Buckra”, or the variant,
“Buckra-man”, were forms employed by slaves of the South Carolina Sea
Islands to refer to non-slave-owning white men; and “poor white trash”,
or “mean white men”, were widely used to refer to poorer white
persons.</p>
<p>Ceremonial forms were also a part of the equipment of white persons
used to address, and to refer to Negroes, slave and free. “Mammy” was
perhaps the title of highest respect bestowed upon slaves, with “uncle”
and “auntie” ranging respectively a shade lower.<a href="#fn11"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>
“Old man”—not referring to age—and “daddy” seemed to be a bit more
respectful than just the Christian name, which was generally used, and
“boy” or “girl” when used in terms of address seemed to border on
familiarity, although they were also used as terms of reference. Legal
records of the colonial period refer to “Negro Sam” or “Negro Mary”
where slaves are mentioned at all, with the “N” widely capitalized until
about the middle of the nineteenth century. Yet, the literature of the
entire period is replete with “nigger” used as a form of address, as a
term of reference, as a noun, and as an adjective.</p>
<p>If, having addressed one another in appropriate ways, a conversation
were necessary between a white person and a slave, the latter either
removed his hat, or touched it, as though he might remove it, at the end
of every sentence. If he had no hat, he pulled at his forelock, kept his
eyes on the ground while the conversation lasted, and uttered “sir” or
“ma’am” at least once in every complete sentence.</p>
<p>On the plantation or farm, and <span class="pagenum">194</span>within
the home, or “big house” other forms appeared. “No slave,” says Steward,
“was ever allowed to sit down in the presence of master or mistress.”<a
href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> If he were sitting when addressed,
he would stand; and, if out of doors, would remove his hat. The
errand-boy stood behind the master’s chair; and the waiters or
waitresses, of course, stood while serving meals.</p>
<p>Although intercourse was not prohibited between,, master and slave in
the “big house” and though white persons might, in the presence of
slaves, discuss their own or some particular slaves, yet, except
infrequently, the good servant did not initiate a conversation, nor
enter into one, unless first addressed.<a href="#fn13"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>On the small farms, and perhaps in the case of house servants on the
large plantation, slaves ate in the kitchen. On the large plantations,
there was perhaps a cookhouse for the field hands, or they might be
expected to prepare their own meals in their cabins. On the larger
estates, master and mistress visited the slave cabins or “quarters” on
Sunday; while the children might visit some favored slave in the
quarters at any time. The ceremonial character of the visit is attested
to be a frequent giving, and an occasional interchanging of gifts, such
as cakes, eggs, and the like.</p>
<p>The etiquette was apparently more precise when it came to matters of
contact in the pastimes of hunting and fishing. At these times, status
was indicated by who rode a horse, a colt, or a mule, and who walked; or
who walked first and who walked last.<a href="#fn14"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>When Christmas came to the plantation a set of forms, adequate for
the occasion, were observed. The time for celebration, while not
uniform, generally lasted “as long as the yule log burned”. At any rate,
on Christmas day, it was the custom to surprise another by calling
“Christmas gift” before the other could say it. The one who first called
must then receive a present. Holding this in mind, the slaves would lie
in wait, in order to pounce upon the first white person and to call
“Christmas gift.” If they received small gifts, they would respond by
bowing, by pulling at their hats, or by pulling the forelock. In some
localities the slaves would line up to receive gifts of knives, tobacco,
dolls, handkerchiefs, pieces of money, and occasionally such useful
articles as shoes. As each slave received his present, he would call
out, “Merry Christmas.” After luncheon, a meal would be served for the
slaves in the back yard, at which the master’s family would be
interested spectators. The latter, however, would stand while the slaves
sat, or vice versa.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">195</span>If the slaves wished to hold either a
picnic, or a barbecue, or to combine business with pleasure at a
corn-husking, they first sought the master’s permission. If the answer
were favorable, they invited the master and his family to attend, and
reserved seats for them at the grounds. Before the actual festivities
began, the slaves would march by the master, perhaps for inspection, and
during the procession or festivities, would find some occasion to extol
the master’s virtues, perhaps by an extemporaneous song. When the time
came to dine the white persons present, who either stood while the
slaves sat, or vice versa, were served first; visiting slaves were
served next, house slaves next, and field hands last of all.</p>
<p>House-servants seemed generally to attend the weddings of their young
masters and mistresses. Thus, when a young master, who had married away
from home, returned with his bride, he was expected to present her first
to his parents, then to his kinspeople, and finally to the
house-servants.</p>
<p>Marriage ceremonies were occasionally observed for favored slaves of
the household, although it appears that such unions were neither legally
binding nor recognized. However, whether a slave married or was merely
joined, the first step was to procure the master’s permission. If the
slave, bride or groom, were a house servant, the young men and women of
the master’s family would assume charge of the proceedings, frequently
providing suitable finery for the groom, or making a trousseau for the
bride, and occasionally bedecking her at the ceremony with the family
jewels.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> For the actual “ceremony” the
slaves would appear at the Great House, where the ceremony might be said
by a white minister, or a colored minister, or by the master, in the
dining-room or hall. After the ceremony, a wedding supper might be held
on the back porch, or in the kitchen, and occasionally there would be a
dance, on the back porch.</p>
<p>Field hands seemed not to fare so well as house servants in this
matter. They were married in the cabins or quarters, by the master, or
by a colored preacher. One master in performing the ceremony used an
“old copy of an English reader” for a prayer-book; another said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Come on in de house chillum.’ … He set down an’ look at us. ‘Now,’
he say, ‘I don’ want no fussin’ ner fightin.’ De way ter live happy is
ter be forgivin’ an’ not start no ruckus. I hopes you have a long life
togedder, an’ if’n de Lawd send little niggers, dey’ll be mos’
welcome.’<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the larger plantations, perhaps, even this latter procedure was
neglected, and the slaves needed to resort to the “blanket-<span
class="pagenum">196</span>wedding.” This type of “marriage” was
described by one slave as follows: “We come togedder in de same cabin
an’ she brings her blanket and lays it down sides mine, an’ we gits
married dat way.”<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>If, on the other plantations where there was more or less intimate
relationship, the owner were perchance sick unto death, the slaves would
be called to the bedside to receive a parting blessing and to bid the
master, or perhaps the mistress, farewell. After death came, the slaves
might attend the master’s funeral, but favored places in the procession
or at the service would be given to the house servants.</p>
<p>However, when a slave died, a colored or white minister might
officiate at the services, and occasionally both racial groups might
attend. The slave was then buried in a section reserved for slaves—on
the plantation in the “plantation” cemetery,” but in “slave cemeteries”
in the cities.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>One interesting development of ceremonial observances came in the
association of whites and blacks in matters of religion. From 1619 to
about 1641, while indenture was becoming slavery, Negroes who were
baptized and who thus became Christians were released from such slavery
as then existed for the current belief was that Christians could not
rightfully, nor righteously, be enslaved. Later, however, the notion
developed that bondage was a small price for the Negro to pay for the
benefits of Christianity. Baptism, formerly a means of manumission, then
became merely a preliminary to membership in the churches.</p>
<p>It thus happened, that, through the eighteenth century, though the
development is difficult to trace, Negroes were generally attached to
churches or denominations, in which might be also found white persons.<a
href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> By the beginning of the nineteenth
century, they were members of churches along with and frequently in
greater numbers than white people, and were also found in separate
organizations.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Good form seemed to require separation of the racial groups in the
church services proper. In the older and more established churches,
perhaps, such as the Episcopalian, the Negroes sat in the galleries;
while on the other hand, and until the insurrection of Nat Turner, about
1831, separation was generally not practiced in the churches affiliated
with the Methodist and Baptist denominations. By 1835, race distinctions
were clear, for slaves might be seen seated in galleries, or at the
<span class="pagenum">197</span>sides of churches, in separate sections,
and occasionally even in separate churches.</p>
<p>Generally the whites and blacks partook of the Lord’s Supper
separately, and were also baptized separately, although in the latter
ceremony, at least until Negro preachers were ordained, white ministers
officiated. However, before a slave was baptized he needed to obtain
permission from his master. Christening and naming of slave babies, by
white persons, was not an unheard of phenomenon. In fact, some observers
seem to believe that many classic, if not serio-comic, appellations of
Negroes—such as Plato, Lily, Madame de Stael—were acquired in this
manner.</p>
<p>How slaves were received as members into the churches of mixed
membership is not clear. In the instance related by Frederick Douglass,
of his conversion in a camp-meeting, he came from behind the
minister—where the slaves stood—and stopped, still standing, half-way to
the “mourners” pen, where white converts sat.</p>
<p>As slaves became members of the regularly established churches in
increasing numbers, there grew up, in the cities especially, the
practice of holding separate services for white and black members. At
first special services for slaves were held by the white minister in the
white church; but later, separate churches for slaves were established
with white pastors. The latter development, however, tended to be an
outgrowth of an organization of slaves within the general church, in
which the slaves exercised much the same powers over their members as
did the white persons over their members. Complete separation ensued
when slaves were assigned to separate churches, over which Negro
ministers officiated. This situation was generally, but not altogether,
delayed until after 1865.</p>
<p>Negro ministers were perhaps not accepted in large numbers until
after the beginning of the nineteenth century. In some instances, they
were “graduates” of the plantation, where they had either been
supervised or subject to the censorship of the master, or, in other
instances were talented persons who had, in company with some white
person, previously traveled about preaching to white and black alike;
although in many instances they spoke only to white audiences. As a
matter of fact, unless a Negro preacher had some white person to “speak
for him,” and to guarantee his orthodoxy, it appears that he might be
whipped or otherwise punished.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Separate phases of this development appear, about 1858, in Macon,
Georgia, where according to report there were three churches for
Negroes—one of which had a white minister, the others Negro ministers.
Moreover, the congregation with the white minister was pay<span
class="pagenum">198</span>ing him a regular salary and had erected and
paid for its building.</p>
<p>In formal and public relations, forms were sufficiently distinct to
be noted. White persons and slaves seldom, almost never, walked in
public together. Yet, it appears, free Negroes were not always required
to observe the rule. Meeting a white person on the street, Negroes, as
in Richmond, Virginia, were “required to give the wall,” and if
necessary to get off the walk into the street. However, even though
Negroes did not get off the walk, white persons were not expected to
push them off. Public conversation was also thought improper unless the
relationship between white and black were known as that of master and
slave. Moreover, the responsibility of beginning a conversation always
rested with the white person.</p>
<p>On the other hand, evidence appears that Negroes frequently served as
musicians for dances and balls given by white people. Others might even
attend, and stand around on the floor, or at the windows. Body-servants
occasionally attended their masters and mistresses to the theatres.
Public funerals of local or national characters would witness a
gathering of both whites and blacks.</p>
<p>Travel conditions of the period were not so complex as they were
later. Moreover, slaves seldom had any occasion to travel, and
practically none to travel alone. The private traveling arrangement of a
large slaveowner throws some light on the general situation. In this
case Negro outriders would come first, then the master, later the family
carriage, and behind that slaves ranged in the order of their status,
with the most lowly, of course, bringing up the rear.</p>
<p>On the stage-coaches, until about the fourth decade of the nineteenth
century, Negroes rode inside unless the coach was overcrowded with white
people. On the trains, body-servants and occasionally free Negroes rode
in the “first-class”, or “ladies’ coach,” but unattached slaves rode in
the “second-class” car next to the engine, along with smokers from the
ladies’ car. The evidence, not precise and taken for what it is worth,
indicates that there were no special accommodations in stations and
depots for Negroes.</p>
<p>On the steamboats, of which there were many during the period of
slavery, white persons of the wealthier classes commonly rode on the
main deck, while slaves and poorer whites commonly rode “forward of the
shaft” or on a lower deck. A body-servant could, however, remain on the
main deck with his owner, and might sleep outside the owner’s cabin
door. Free Negroes rode on the main deck, but were apparently not given
staterooms in which to sleep. In one instance, they seemed to sleep on
the floor of the lounging room.</p>
<p>Meals on a steamboat brought all the matter of rank and precedence to
the fore. At this time the captain and white passengers would dine
first; after them came the white members of the crew, <span
class="pagenum">199</span>and then the Negro crew members and slaves.
Free Negroes offered a problem in such circumstances. In one instance,
since they could neither dine with free whites nor slave blacks, they
took their meals in the pantry. In another instance, they dined after
the white crew but before the Negro crew.</p>
<p>Clothing as a class distinction, and considered as a derived form of
etiquette, showed inter-, and intra-group delineation. The slave’s outer
garments were commonly made of cotton osnaburg, known as “Negro cloth.”
In very few inventories of slave clothing was underclothing mentioned at
all. Slave children, some thought, ran around naked until later they
were given a “negro shirt,”—described as a “cross between a gent’s
undergarment and an ordinary potato-bag.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When dey big ’nough ter put on anything, it’s a shirt. Boys and gals
de same. Run ’roun in dat shirt-tail. Some de gals tie belt ’round de
middle, and dat’s de only diffrunce. … Dis hyar shu’t wuh made jes like
a sach. Got hole in de top fo’ de haid, an’ holes fo’ de arms. Pull it
ovah youah haid, push yo’ arms t’rough de side holes, and dar yo’ is.<a
href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the cities, however, slaves generally dressed in the cast-off
clothing of white persons, or occasionally purchased clothing for
themselves. Olmsted remarks that “the finest French clothes, embroidered
waistcoats, patent leather shoes, brooches, silk hats, kid gloves, and
<em>eau mitte fleurs</em>”<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> were by no means
absent. Livery, in the instances where it was used at all, was generally
confined to the cities.</p>
<p>The city slave also enjoyed a degree of association with white
persons quite different from the field hand. Masters, in the cities and
towns, frequently owned more servants than they could profitably employ
at household tasks. These latter were often allowed to “hire themselves”
to persons who either needed more help, or to persons who, unable to
purchase their own slaves, nevertheless sought the status of
slave-owners. When persons are mobile, as in the city, relations are
more impersonal. Again, attempts to maintain social distance and to
preserve the superficial signs of status evoke newer and more multiplied
forms. These reasons, among others perhaps, explain why the etiquette of
the city and among city slaves was more complex and more formal than
that common to the plantation and field hands.</p>
<p>There is reason to believe that cities and towns, during the slave
period, contributed more than their share of the free Negro population,
and certainly more independent Negroes than the rural sections. Some
city slaves learned trades, others engaged in small businesses, or
became self-supporting, or accumulated money sufficient to purchase
their own freedom or that of some kins-person. These conditions also
developed “exceptional slaves”; that is to say, slaves who had achieved
independence, if not freedom. From among many in<span
class="pagenum">200</span>stances, we might mention that one Cato, of
Darien, Georgia, was allowed to carry a gun, in violation of the law;
C.G. Hall saw a slave, traveling from Montgomery to New Orleans, who
“was frequently entrusted with large sums of money and business of
importance.” One Frank, of Macon, Georgia, “had become rich, was the
owner of considerable town property, carried on a mercantile business
with great success, and was respected and esteemed by everyone who knew
him.”<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Slaves practiced distinctions and observed an etiquette among
themselves. “Uncle” and “Auntie” were, among them, terms of respect, and
“de nigger” was a term of contempt. In their own gatherings, they
adopted the customary salutations of “sir” and “madam” and referred to
themselves as “ladies” and “gentlemen.” House servants looked down on
field hands, and considered field labor a disgrace. The field hand
responded with a defense mechanism of pretending to hate house servants,
but considered an assignment to the household as a distinct promotion.
Slaves, of whatever rank, considered their lot more perfect in
proportion to the wealth and influence of their owners. The
status-complex, indicated among the white people where it was said that
a judge owned a house with two chimneys, and a colonel owned one with
three, was reflected on the plantation where the washerwoman, the cook,
the butler and the carriage-driver all had understudies, “to do the
dirty work.” At White Sulphus Springs, for example, a resort for upper
class planters, precedence and rank were seen in the morning airing of
babies, where nurses and “mammies” sat on the hotel veranda in order of
the social consequence attached to their own owners. At Beaver Dam
Springs, in Tennessee, Ingraham observed that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the masters and mistresses have left the dining room, the long
table is re-laid, and they who whilom served are now feasted. I have
been twice to look at them. Not less than one hundred Ethiopian and
Nubian ladies and gentlemen were seated in the places occupied an hour
before by their masters and mistresses. There were servants of “de lower
class,”—scullions, ostlers, and bootblacks,—to wait on them.<a
href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evidence points to the fact that, with the possible exception of
certain exceptional slaves who had had contact with abolitionists, or
with anti-slavery agitators, the majority of the slaves were thoroughly
accommodated to their status as inferiors. Older slaves would show the
child “a nigger’s place,” perhaps through slaps and whipping, but most
likely through their own accommodations. In due time the etiquette and
status common to slaves would then become entirely accepted.</p>
<p>Yet, the slave was not entirely without controls of his own, nor was
he altogether a passive factor in the process of adjustment. Etiquette
is in fact a reciprocal act. <span class="pagenum">201</span>That is to
say, a gesture or an observance on the part of one person calls out the
complement of that observance or gesture on the part of the other
person. Slaves early learned this, and would either laugh, or grin, when
they committed breaches of etiquette, or when they did not know
precisely how to act. As a consequence the laugh and grin came to be
known as signs of “right attitudes.” Likewise, the slave occasionally
quoted Scripture to emphasize a point that otherwise would be considered
impudent. But, it is in his interest in imitating the manners of white
persons, in the incorporation of these forms into his own life,
especially in the cities and among the house servants, that we discern
the extent of the assimilation of the slave to the institution of
slavery.</p>
<p>Generalizing at this point upon some of the statements and materials
hitherto presented, it would seem accurate to state that: (1) There was
a code of etiquette in slavery that covered practically the whole of
relations existing between persons of the white and Negro groups; (2)
The code was different in different places and at different times, and
reflected the changes that occurred in the social organization; (3) the
forms had become inculcated into the attitudes of both white and black,
free and slave, and were generally accepted and expected. To the extent
that it was thus universally accepted and universally practiced, we may
say that the code exercised a form of social control over interracial
relations, and one that Spencer and Sumner were wont to call
elementary.</p>
<h2 id="testing-the-control-of-etiquette">Testing the Control of
Etiquette</h2>
<p>A test of the foregoing generalizations could be obtained if
instances were discovered where etiquette was neglected, was unobserved,
or had not developed, between whites and blacks. A situation, where
etiquette did not control, is in fact found in the relation of free
Negroes with white persons.</p>
<p>The free Negro class had developed from several sources. There were
those who had originally served their terms of indenture, and who had
left a heritage of freedom to their descendents; others who had acquired
freedom by becoming Christians before restrictions were placed upon this
course and method; still others who had been manumitted individually or
in groups by masters who believed slavery incompatible with the theory
of democracy, or with the principles of Christianity. Still others, and
perhaps the greatest number, had been manumitted by masters for personal
or sentimental reasons,—among which we might mention cohabitation, blood
relationship, a feeling that certain individual Negroes were above a
slave status, or even a conviction that long and faithful service
deserved some reward. As a consequence of these, and other factors, the
free Negro class increased constantly in total numbers, if not <span
class="pagenum">202</span> in rate, from 1790 to 1860, and amounted to
approximately one-tenth of the Negroes in America at the
Emancipation.</p>
<p>When a slave was manumitted, his legal status was fixed, so far as
the ex-master was concerned. There remained, however, the definition of
his social status, both by himself and by others. Having acquired a new
legal status, it was natural for the free Negro to see his condition in
a new light, and to conceive his adjustments in terms of attitudes
adopted by white freemen. On the other hand, it was difficult for white
persons to treat him as free; moreover the hostility which ensued was
not submerged in any discovered social ritual. “Indeed,” says Wright,
“if any change at all resulted from the rise of the new class, it caused
a more strict definition of class boundaries, a more firm repulsion of
the Negro, and an outcasting of any white man who went across to the
Negroes.”<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>On the legal side, the restrictions on free Negroes passed by the
several state legislatures over the entire period of slavery, and the
movements designed to colonize them in Africa or in some separate
section of the United States, all attest to the problem created by the
rise of the class. The first half of the nineteenth century witnessed a
rather continual debasement of the free Negro’s legal status to that of
the slave. By the later fifties, indeed, the almost universal sentiment
was that the class constituted a distinct menace, as criminals, as
possible inciters of insurrection, and as object lessons of the
benefits, and sometimes of the disadvantages, of freedom for slaves. By
indirection, then, we arrive at the conclusion that something was
lacking in the relations of free Negroes and white persons that was
present in the relations of slaves and white persons. Shall we then
assume that the social ritual was the missing factor?</p>
<p>What, then, were the adjustments made by the free Negroes to their
anomalous situation? On the one hand, they entered occupations requiring
personal service, or became tradesmen, or semi-skilled and, in some
instances, even skilled workers. This occupational specialization
doubtless relieved the friction that would have resulted had they
entered more widely into competitive relations, even provided they had
had either means or opportunity. On the other hand, there were the
“exceptional” free Negroes who were occasionally teachers, some
planters, a physician or so, and several inn-keepers. Some among them,
accumulated slaves, and were known as slaveholders, not of kinsmen, but
for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>Since however, relations between white and black were largely
personal with an etiquette based upon personal relations, free Negroes
tended, on the one hand, to settle in communities where white people
seldom intruded; or to go, on the other hand, into the cities, where
<span class="pagenum">203</span>contacts were more impersonal, and where
they could move as symbols, rather than as persons. They could never
completely cut off communication and contact with white people. Their
presence in the cities, while reducing personal relations to a minimum,
nevertheless implied some intimate contacts. The adjustment that was
expected of them under such circumstances is expressed in the Black Code
of Louisiana as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Free people of color ought never to presume to conceive themselves
equal to the white; but, on the contrary, they ought to yield to them in
every occasion, and never speak or answer to them, except with
respect.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An analysis of the attitudes of free Negroes, who attained places of
respect and influence in communities where they dwelt with white
persons, forces upon us the conclusion that they conformed, in spirit,
to this code, and that they attained their positions not because they
were free, but because they either reverted to, or never departed from,
the etiquette considered proper to the association of all white persons
with all Negroes, slave or free.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>In other words, the free Negro could adjust himself to his new
status, either by betaking himself to a place where no white persons
were present, or by adopting the etiquette common to slavery, if and
when he associated with white persons at all. If he did neither, the
only outcome of association with white persons would be friction,
disharmony, conflict.</p>
<p>Summarizing, we see the relations and the etiquette commonly accepted
between slaves and whites reflected among the free Negroes. We also see
further evidence of a caste system sustained by legislation. But,
perhaps, what appears most significant is that the Negro was able to
adjust himself to circumstances, and to gain a modicum of security and
recognition even in the face of excessively restrictive formal
regulations. The adjustment—or if you wish, the accommodation—was
facilitated when, as, and if, the free Negro retained a conception of
himself, and the white man’s conception of him, as subordinate in the
social scale. The adjustment, generally present when the etiquette of
race relations was resorted to, or absent when it was not utilized,
might then be understood as a function of that etiquette.</p>
<p>But, perhaps in view of the purposes at hand, and considering the
confusion that resulted from attempts of white persons and free Negroes
to accommodate themselves to the anomalous situation, what is more
significant is that we begin to arrive at a conception of the problem
that arose later, when, by emancipation, all Negroes had become free;
and when presumably, the moral controls of the <span
class="pagenum">204</span>slave had been superseded by legal and
political enactments.</p>
<p>The last generalization may be further elaborated. We might, to the
already numerous and confusing interpretations of the period of
Reconstruction, add another to the effect that the period, stripped of
its legal and political implications, was one in which adjustment
between the races could, and did, not proceed for the reason that (1)
the controls, characteristic of ceremonial government, had been
overthrown and (2) that no basic controls had replaced them. Negroes
seemed to believe that change in legal or political status was
synonymous with, and equivalent to, change in social status. Southern
white people, on the other hand, generally denied the assumption. No
basis of agreement was reached until the Negro, disillusioned with his
freedom, began to revert to the attitudes and the etiquette that had
been characteristic of slavery; and that seem to be characteristic of
social relations wherever social superior and social inferior meet.</p>
<p>Thenceforward, to compress a period of history into one sentence,
interracial friction has been relieved by the simple process of
reverting to the etiquette of the period of slavery. Where this
adjustment has been accomplished relative harmony prevails. In those
instances where etiquette has not developed, or where for whatever
reason it is neglected, friction, and occasionally conflict, arises.</p>
<h3 id="interrelation-of-etiquette-and-education">Interrelation of
Etiquette and Education</h3>
<p>Considering the facts and interpretations so far advanced, the
question arises whether or not formal education, recognizing a code of
interracial etiquette that is based upon the assumption of the
inferiority of the Negro, should attempt to offer substitutes. The
question becomes important in proportion as the notion of innate
inferiority of races is rejected,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> or as it is recognized
that increasingly large numbers of Negroes become restive when social
inferiority is assumed. Stated, for example, as a phase of the “cardinal
principles of secondary education” the question would be: should
education seek to undermine, or to strengthen the etiquette of race
relations in order to develop high citizenship and ethical character?
Efforts to answer the question must inevitably seek to rationalize
values, may lead to prophecy, and undoubtedly will arouse
controversy.</p>
<p>However, among the arguments advanced to support the question, there
is the thesis which regards education as a means of providing techniques
with which to meet the conditions of life. Those who accept this
philosophy seem also to admit that the present code offers a definite
handicap to Negroes who would improve their social status. Moreover,
they point out that Negroes should be prepared for the good life, and
should be taught <span class="pagenum">205</span> racial self respect
and race consciousness. In no way, they say, might these objectives be
attained more quickly than in a complete overthrow of any system that
proposed to keep Negroes in a permanently inferior position.</p>
<p>Education from this point of view, should evaluate the <em>status
quo</em> and should indicate the positively hurtful, or dangerous,
social tendencies. Social planning, as an outgrowth of education, could
then develop a rational statesmanship for race problems that confront
us. Since appreciation of the worth of the individual is a cardinal
principle of education and a value of American society, education should
then seek to obliterate artificial differences among men, and to change
the attitudes that have arisen to fortify the belief in differences.
Recognizing these goals education will go far toward realizing the
democratic social order to which we already lay claim.</p>
<p>A more militant stand holds that recognition of Negroes as equals of
all other racial groups should be forced. If then in the social
organization inequality of the Negro is assumed, Negro students should
read Negro history, should study and interpret the Constitution, and
should acquire in these ways a sense of race pride, and a familiarity
with the devices that may be used to force equality before the law.
Although this philosophy takes no direct stand on etiquette, it seems to
hold that, along with all other assumptions of inferiority, the
interracial code should be changed, if not actually overthrown.</p>
<p>Advocates remind us that etiquette is taught in the “finishing”
schools. Then they ask: “If etiquette can be taught in one type of
institution, why not in another? Why then should not all schools seek to
teach a new code of manners, especially when it may be admitted that
such a code would effect more amicable interracial relations?”</p>
<p>There is some disagreement among the proponents of this latter point
of view. However, Negroes seem generally to expect the reorganization of
etiquette to begin in the colleges—those institutions that propose, and
are expected, to furnish leadership for the Negro group. Since
college-trained persons are those from whom complaints on the score
generally come, and if those who would be free must themselves strike
the blow, there seems to be ground for the contention that colleges, so
far as educational institutions attempt such at all, should make the
first assault upon inferior status.</p>
<p>In this regard, however, it must be noted that Negroes exhibit
mutually antagonistic attitudes. When and if college students show any
desire or tendency to break away from custom, it is quickly charged that
colleges are radical and that students are irresponsible. On the other
hand, those same people who make these charges, also presume to believe
that only through the efforts of the intelligentsia—college students and
graduates—will <span class="pagenum">206</span> there come any assault
upon the customs that bind them to an inferior status. Occasional
complaints decry the conformist tendency in Negro colleges. The
objection is offered that these latter teach the same subjects in the
same way as the white colleges when, as a matter of racial necessity,
they should be preparing Negroes to break the chains of social
thralldom.</p>
<p>Taking the opposite view, however, there are those who point out that
the etiquette of race relations is “in the mores”; that the mores change
slowly; and that they perhaps cannot be changed at all by taking
thought.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> The implication of this point of
view, occasionally coming by actual declaration, seems to be that there
is little that education can do to answer the question of etiquette in
interracial relations. Some advocates go so far as to show that with all
the schools in America, the code of etiquette and relations of the races
are about what they would be if there were no schools at all.</p>
<p>Still others have indicated that the mores, when they change at all,
do so as a result of some change already inaugurated in the field of
material culture. Indeed, Ogburn points out that change in the material
culture precedes change in the non-material culture, of which latter
etiquette is a part. Moreover, he shows that a “cultural lag” exists
since industrial and economic development not only precede, but also
outstrip, development in the social attitudes and organization.<a
href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> If then, as indicated by this
theory, a change of status for groups might result from invention more
frequently than from education and legislation, it could readily be
conceded that the invention of a new machine—say the cottonpicker—might
effect greater changes in the status of the Negro than college degrees,
or even a congressional enactment.</p>
<p>A corollary of this hypothesis is that conscious attempts to change
the mores generally result in revolution.<a href="#fn32"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>
There then remain two possible courses of action: (1) to expect
inventions, when and as they come, to effect changes in the social
order; or (2) to seek to change conditions immediately, and thus bring
about revolution.</p>
<p>The social psychologists insist, however, that education brings new
status. Moreover, when a person attains a new status, he experiences
changes in attitudes. In consequence he expects no longer to be bound by
an old code of social relationships, but adopts newer forms toward
others, and expects them to use different forms toward him. Hence, this
theory goes: when a Negro has become educated, and has attained a new
status, old forms reminiscent of an inferior status will neither be used
by, nor toward, him; and his status will be a function of his change in
attitude, or vice versa.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">207</span>The explanation is, however, too
simple. Says Park:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As far as the South is concerned, it is where racial prejudices and
the social order which they perpetuated, are breaking down that racial
animosities are most intense. It is when the Negro invades a new region
that a race riot occurs; it is when he seeks a new place in a new
profession or new occupation that he meets the most vigorous opposition;
it is when he seeks to assume a new dignity that he ceases to be quaint
and becomes ridiculous.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wrenched from its background, this statement may be taken to mean
that, to the extent that it breaks down the social order, or gives
Negroes new conceptions of themselves, or stimulates competition, or
changes the status of Negroes, education will result in widespread
racial animosity, and perhaps in racial conflict.</p>
<p>The effect is occasionally noted when Negroes take only a normal
interest in changing their social status. But when education does cause
a Negro to become “bumptious,” “arrogant,” or “contentious,” it is
confidently expected that race conflict will result. If then both a
non-assertive, and a “bumptious” Negro may stimulate race friction, by
seeking a changed status, and even though neither is taught to neglect
the interracial etiquette, friction may be expected to be increased by
teaching them to neglect the expected and accepted forms. Those who hold
this latter view occasionally suggest that the lesson of the
Reconstruction Period and race relations has been lost.</p>
<p>Finally, it is shown, etiquette is a form of social control.
Developing unconsciously, it comes to be accepted and expected in the
association of social beings, and eventually exerts a very effective
control over the relations of groups and individuals. Persons who behave
in entirely undetermined ways, are considered insane and are
institutionalized; children who have not learned what is expected are
tolerated; boors, who neglect the etiquette, are shunned; and rebels who
disparge the code, are suppressed. These are normal results and
expectations in the world of men, for when persons act in ways that
cannot be understood, communication is broken, adjustment is hampered,
and confusion results. Considering these hypotheses, then, conscious
disregard of the etiquette of racial relations may generally be expected
to bring confusion, and perhaps conflict, between the two groups in
America.</p>
<p>Moreover, men become free by observing the forms of behavior expected
of them. Having done what is expected, they may think what they please,
and they may, in fact, use the etiquette as a mask to hide what they are
thinking. It then becomes no longer necessary to know what to think, but
only what to do. Hence, having learned what to do through long drill,
men may apply their minds to other problems even while they are
associating together.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">208</span>Lastly, no person who is party to an
interchange of social gestures has less control than any other, for the
association is reciprocal, and effects adjustment in the interest both
of peace and of harmony. Again, the forms of behavior expected of, and
exhibited with regard to, a person are a function of his status. If then
he has control; if securing of status precedes change in forms, the man
who wishes to change the forms will consider the loss of control that he
will suffer when and if he seeks to change these before he gains a new
status. In other words, if through education, the status of the Negro
were changed, a change in the etiquette of race relations would be
expected to follow. We may not expect a change in the status of the
Negro from a change in etiquette.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>A solution of the difficulty encountered in postulating a philosophy
of the relation of education and etiquette, especially with regard to
the Negro in America, seems then to be impossible. A summary of the
phases of the code, and a study of the development, show (1) that, over
a period of over three hundred years, an etiquette of race relations has
governed the association of Negroes and white persons; and (2) that the
etiquette has, in some respects, changed but that in many other respects
it remains practically intact. The basis of the code is admittedly the
inferiority of the Negro, and the superiority of the white group. A
change would in many ways be acceptable, and in many other ways would be
desirable. However, if one advocates conscious change in the etiquette,
one looks down a road that bristles with friction, conflict, perhaps
revolution. If one accept the situation, expecting that, as always, it
will take a change for the better, one seems to adopt too fatalistic an
attitude. One certainly does in that way deny the claims of Negroes,
who, having become both race conscious and self-conscious, chafe under
the status of inferiority in a land of democracy. The weight of evidence
seems to be with Sumner and Spencer, but the claim of humanity seems to
be with the Negroes. The solution of the matter is doubtless a matter of
social philosophy, and one that must be rationalized in terms of
circumstance, necessity, and social progress. Until this is done, and in
the presence of the two opposing views, one can only emulate the farmer
who sought to select the shell under which there was a pea. He was
invited to “pay your money, and take your choice.”</p>
