<p><span class="pagenum">412</span>The campaign for health improvement
which is now going on throughout the South is at bottom economic. It is
an effort to increase the efficiency of the people by improving their
health conditions. This is especially true with reference to the Negro.
Along with the movement for health improvement has come a new idea of
the value of human life. During the days of slavery each Negro
represented to his master so many dollars. Then a high estimate was
placed upon the value of a Negro life, for each Negro death represented
a financial loss to the master. After the Negroes were emancipated and
personal ownership ceased, little value was placed upon the life of an
individual Negro; for it was reasoned that if one Negro died another
could be had to take his place.</p>
<p>In recent years much effort has been given to conserving the natural
resources of the nation—that is, its soil, its forests, its minerals,
its waterways, and, most important of all, its people. In this
connection comprehensive studies have been made of the financial loss
which the nation is sustaining because of the waste of its natural
resources. In the <span class="pagenum">413</span> estimate of the
financial loss to the nation on account of sickness and deaths a money
value is placed upon an individual just as it was upon a slave.
Attention is called to the fact that when an individual dies the
community in which that individual lived sustains a financial loss.
The South because of the Negro has the highest death rate of any section
of the country and as a result sustains the greatest financial loss from
bad health conditions.</p>
<p><em>There are in the South U50,000 Negroes seriously sick all the
time.</em> Let us first of all consider the enormous financial losses
which, on account of bad health conditions, the Negroes of the South are
directly sustaining. These losses are in doctor’s bills, cost of the
care of the sick, funeral expenses, and in the earnings which those who
are sick and those who have to take care of them lose. Sickness each
year costs the Negroes in the South about $75,000,000. This is an
average of more than $8 per individual. Estimates show that here in the
South there are probably 450,-000 Negroes who are seriously sick all the
time—that is, they are so ill that some one has to take care of them. If
this sickness were distributed among the entire black population, it
would mean that on an average each Negro inhabitant, man, woman, and
child, would be sick eighteen days in a year.</p>
<p><em>A Negro worker contributes annually $15 to sickness.</em> Of the
450,000 Negroes in the South who are seriously sick all the time,
112,000, or one-fourth, are wage-earners. If the sickness of these
112,000 individuals were distributed among the total Negro workers, it
would mean a loss to each of about ten days. The loss in earnings which
Negro workers sustain annually on account of sickness amounts to some
$45,000,000. When distributed among all Negro workers this loss amounts
to about $15 each. In other words, each Negro worker from his earnings
contributes annually to sickness about $15.</p>
<p><em>Prevention of deaths among Negroes would increase the South’s
population 100,000 each year.</em> The leading authorities on health are
teaching us that a very large percentage of the annual deaths are
preventable. Hundreds of thou<span class="pagenum">414</span>sands of
people die every year who ought to live. This is especially true of
Negroes. It is probable that at least forty-five per cent of the annual
deaths among them are preventable—that is, with proper medical
attention, proper food, proper sanitary surroundings, and proper
observances by the individuals themselves of the rules of health,
forty-five out of every one hundred who die could be saved. If this is
true, then 100,000 of the 225,000 Negroes who die annually in the South
could be kept alive. This would be equal to adding to the population of
the South 100,000 individuals each year.</p>
<p>It further appears that on account of the large number of Negroes who
are seriously sick all the time and the quarter of a million who die
annually, sickness and deaths are costing the Negroes of the South at
least $100,000,000 annually, or an average of over $11 for each Negro
man, woman, and child. On the other hand, with proper
sanitary surroundings, proper attention to the laws of health,
$50,-000,000 of this amount could most likely be saved.</p>
<p><em>The South loses annually because of preventable deaths among
Negroes almost $200,000,000.</em> Attention has been called to the great
financial losses which, because of diseases and deaths, fall directly
upon the Negro. Let us next consider the enormous financial losses which
the South as a section suffers from these same causes. Take, for
example, the 112,000 Negro workers who are seriously sick all the time.
If by sanitary improvements they could be kept well twelve months in the
year, there would be 112,000 additional workers who could help till the
soil, work the mines, construct railroads, build cities, and do other
things for the economic advancement of the South. If these 112.000
Negroes could be added to the working population of any State, the
development of the resources of that State would be greatly
increased—that is, the working population of Texas would be increased 7
per cent, Alabama 11 per cent, Mississippi 13 per cent, and Louisiana 17
per cent. In addition to the large number of Negro workers who
are seriously sick all the time, there are every year 25,000 or 30,000
   who die unnecessarily. The annual loss to the South <span
class="pagenum">415</span> in potential earnings because of preventable
deaths among Negroes is almost $200,000,000—that is, if the Negro
workers who every year die unnecessarily could be kept alive and at work
their earnings for the South during the normal working period of their
lives would amount to almost $200,000,000.</p>
<p><em>Tuberculosis among Negroes costs the South annually enough to
establish 3,500 factories in which 700,000 persons could be
employed.</em> Of all the diseases with which Negroes are afflicted,
tuberculosis is, in many respects, the worst. It is the cause of from 15
to 20 per cent of all their deaths. In other words, one death out of
every six among them is from this disease. The burden that results from
tuberculosis is one of the heaviest that the Negroes have to bear. The
annual deaths among Negroes from tuberculosis amounts to some
thirty-five or forty thousand. It is estimated that each death from
tuberculosis costs about $4,000. On this basis the deaths among Negroes
from tuberculosis cost the South annually over $140,000,000. Consider
for a moment the immense amount of capital that is here lost. If this
capital could be made available for use, think how many factories it
would establish, how many banks it would finance, how many farms in the
South it would run. In a word, if just now the South could have
available this $140,000,000, it would go a considerable way toward
relieving the prevailing financial stringency. According to the census
report on manufacturing, the average capital invested in a manufacturing
establishment in the South is about $45,000. The average number of
employees in a factory is about 225. On this basis, the amount that
tuberculosis among Negroes annually costs the South would furnish
the capital for 3,500 manufacturing establishments in which over 700,000
persons could be employed.</p>
<p><em>The financial losses to important cities through waste because of
the lack of the conservation of Negro health is greater than all the
revenues which the cities raise.</em> Let us next consider the financial
losses which through lack of improvement of Negro sanitary conditions
the important cities of the South are sustaining. From data given in a
<span class="pagenum">416</span> recently issued volume of the United
States Census Bureau on “Financial Statistics in Cities,” we are able to
make comparisons of the revenues which the cities of the South raise
with the estimated losses to these cities because of bad health
conditions among Negroes. These comparisons indicate that each year the
losses to cities of the South because of health conditions among Negroes
is almost equal to all revenues which the cities through taxes and all
other sources raise.</p>
<p><em>In two cities the estimated loss from Negro sickness and death is
equal to the total city revenues. Birmingham </em>per capita* of her
total population raises in revenues $14 and through bad health
conditions among her Negro population loses $14 <em>per capita</em>
Mobile <em>per capita</em> of her total population raises in revenues
$20 and through bad health conditions among her Negro population
loses $20 <em>per capita</em> In three cities the estimated losses
from Negro sickness and deaths is greater than the revenues which these
cities through all sources raise. Montgomery <em>per capita</em> of her
total population raises in revenue $18 and through bad health conditions
among her Negro population loses $22 <em>per capita</em> Savannah
<em>per capita</em> of her total population raises in revenues $21 and
through bad health conditions among her Negro population loses $28
<em>per capita</em> Charleston <em>per capita</em> of her total
population raises in revenues $15.42 and through bad health conditions
among her Negro population loses $27 <em>per capita.</em></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is of course understood that the loss to
cities because of bad health conditions among Negroes is not so much
in actual cash as it is in the loss, through waste, of a
natural resource that ought to be utilized—that is, within these cities
there are thousands of Negroes who are unnecessarily sick and hundreds
who unnecessarily die. These Negroes, through education and sanitary
improvement, ought to be kept alive and made healthy and efficient to
the highest degree, in order that as a natural resource they could
be fully utilized.</span></p>
<p><em>Combined revenues raised by States, counties, and incorporated
places, because of the lack of health conser</em><span
class="pagenum">417</span><em>ration, do not equal what States lose
through Negro sickness and deaths.</em> The Census Bureau a few weeks
ago issued a bulletin on “Wealth, Debt, and Taxation.” Among
other things, information is given in this bulletin as to the
total revenues raised in a State, by the State itself, by the counties,
and by incorporated places. A comparison of the losses which, because of
the lack of health conservation, the South is sustaining from Negro
sickness and deaths, with these combined revenues, indicates that these
losses about equal the total revenues raised in the South, by the
States, by the counties, and by incorporated places. In eight States the
losses sustained on account of Negro sickness and deaths are greater
than the total combined revenues which are raised within these
States.</p>
<p>In Alabama the combined revenues <em>per capita</em> of the total
population were $7.45 and the loss from Negro sickness and deaths $15
<em>per capita</em> In Arkansas the combined revenues were $6.37 <em>per
capita</em> and the loss from Negro sickness and deaths $9 <em>per
capita.</em> In Georgia the combined revenues were $9.61 <em>per
capita</em> and the loss from Negro sickness and deaths $16 <em>per
capita.</em> In Louisiana the combined revenues were $13.03 <em>per
capita</em> and the loss from Negro sickness and deaths $15 <em>per
capita.</em> In Mississippi the combined revenues were $7.79 <em>per
capita</em> and the loss from Negro sickness and deaths $20 <em>per
capita.</em> In North Carolina the combined revenues were $6.16 <em>per
capita</em> and the loss from Negro sickness and deaths $11 <em>per
capita.</em> In South Carolina the combined revenues were $5.91 <em>per
capita</em>and the loss from Negro sickness and deaths $19
<em>per capita.</em> In Virginia the combined revenues were $9.74
<em>per capita</em> and the loss from Negro sickness and deaths <em>per
capita</em>.</p>
<p><em>The value of a Negro to-day is five times what it was in the days
of slavery.</em> In connection with this discussion of the loss which
the South is sustaining because of sickness and deaths among Negroes, it
is of interest to note that, on the present basis of estimating the
value of a human life, a Negro in the South to-day is worth several
times as  <span class="pagenum">418</span> much as he was worth in the
days of slavery. The value of the 4,000,000 slaves which the war between
the States freed was about two billion dollars—that is, the average
value of a slave was about $500. On the present basis of estimating the
value of human life a Negro in the South is valued at about $2,500, and
the nine million Negroes in the South have a money value of over
twenty-two billion dollars. On this basis, the loss to the South to-day
when a Negro dies is about five times as great as it was in the days of
slavery. If then the South of <em>ante-bellum</em> days had an interest
in conserving the health of the Negroes, to a much greater degree has
the South of the present an interest in conserving their health.</p>
<p><em>As an asset of the South Negroes are worth one and a half times
as much as the assessed value of all taxable property.</em> The value of
all the land in the South is about ten billion dollars. The value of all
the farm property is about twelve billion dollars. The assessed value of
all the taxable property in the South is some fourteen billion dollars.
The nine million Negroes in the South are worth twenty-two billion
dollars—that is, as an asset of the South they are worth more than all
the land or all the farm property. They are worth over one and a half
times as much as the total taxable property of the South. Because of
their value, it is very important then that the Negroes be made healthy.
It is for this reason that white men and black men are working side by
side to help improve their health conditions.</p>
<p><em>By means of health improvement and education the efficiency of
the Negro can be doubled.</em> One of the slogans of this century is
efficiency. The idea of efficiency has come into the South. It is
realized that for the South to take her proper economic place in the
nation the efficiency of her population has got to be greatly increased.
The best working machine is one in which there is the greatest amount of
power generated in proportion to the amount of energy expended. From the
standpoint of efficiency the Negro is at present a poor working machine.
On account]{.font4} <span class="pagenum">419</span> of bad health and a
lack of training and efficiency, he is expending about one-half the
energy that he is capable of expending, and as a result is doing about
one-half the work that he is capable of doing. On the other hand,
because of premature deaths, the number of years that he works is about
one-half of what they should be. The average life of a Negro is now
about thirty-five years. His period of productive work is about fifteen
years. If the average length of Negro life was increased to forty-five
or fifty years—and this can be done by sanitary improvement—the length
of time that the average Negro could work would be increased to from
thirty to thirty-five years. It is possible within this century to so
improve the health conditions of Negroes that their death rate would be
reduced one-half and their average length of life increased
one-half.</p>
<p><em>Increasing the efficiency of the Negro by means of education and
better health conditions equals adding five million additional workers
to the population of the South.</em> There are in the South five million
Negroes who are engaged in gainful occupations—that is, they are helping
to develop the resources of the South. Now if by education and
health improvement the efficiency of these five million black men and
women can be doubled it will be equal to adding five million additional
workers to the population of the South; likewise, if the period of
productive work of the average Negro can be doubled, it will be equal to
adding another five million to the working population of the South.</p>
<p><em>The death rate among Negroes can be decreased.</em> Recent
mortality statistics appear to indicate that the death rate among
Negroes is decreasing. Ten years ago the average annual death rate per
thousand was about 29. Now it is about 23. As an indication of what can
be done in the matter of decreasing the death rate, a recent report
states that in Robeson County, North Carolina, the death rate has been
reduced from 18 to 12 per thousand. This county is in a malarial
district and 55 per cent of the population are Negroes and Indians. The
death rate of the Negroes was over 40 per cent higher than that of the
whites. The illiter<span class="pagenum">420</span>acy in the county is
40 per cent higher than the average for the whole State. This record in
health improvement was accomplished in three years. To the county is
means a saving of 100 lives every year, or, in money value,
$290,000. The most remarkable thing concerning health improvement in
this county is that the death rate from preventable diseases has been
reduced 70 per cent.</p>
<p><em>White people and black people are cooperating to conserve Negro
health.</em> One of the most encouraging things in the crusade for Negro
health improvement is the hearty manner with which white people and
black people are cooperating in this movement for the common
welfare. Last year at a conference in New Orleans, called to
consider how Negro health conditions might be improved, State and city
health officers from all parts of the South in meetings with black men
discussed the situation and advised as to the best things that should be
done. The very cordial and active assistance given by State and City
Boards of Health, by State Departments of Education, by white
women’s clubs, and other agencies to the recently held National Negro
Health Week is another instance of this cooperation. The highest
expression of this cooperation is the large place that is given in this
Congress to the consideration of “Health and Race Relations.”</p>
<p><em>The Negro will do his part in the creating of a greater
South.</em> In her crisis the South has found the Negro dependable. Was
it at New Orleans in the War of 1812 when, at the call of General
Jackson, he fought gallantly for the common defense? Was it in the War
between the States, when the white men of the South were away on the
battlefields, that he at home cared for their women and children? The
South of to-day is facing a great economic crisis. The old system, the
old methods in agriculture, and other things have become obsolete; new
systems, new methods demanding more skill and intelligence are being
instituted. In order to develop these systems to their highest degree
every element in her population must be made efficient. The Negro has
ever had the interest of the South at heart. In <span
class="pagenum">421</span> this new crisis that the South is now facing,
in the economic transformation that is now taking place, he can be
depended upon to do his part. He is earnestly studying his own needs. He
sees the great handicap which bad health has placed upon him. With the
assistance of the white man he will remove this handicap. He will make
himself efficient and do his part in creating out of the new South a
greater South.</p>
