<p><span class="pagenum">304</span> In large urban centers of population
Negroes generally contribute a disproportionate share of delinquency and
crime in relation to their percentage of the total population. But the
fact that Negroes contribute an abnormal percentage of delinquents and
criminals to the total such cases should not be confused with the
question: Are Negroes more criminally inclined than other racial or
nationality groups?</p>
<p>In most popular discussions of delinquency and crime there is a
tendency to cite the abnormal number of Negro delinquents and criminals,
and then proceed to generalizations regarding inherent racial
characteristics.</p>
<p>In such popular discussions two rather distinct viewpoints are
prevalent. There are those who hasten to take a defense attitude and
dismiss the citation of an increase in delinquency and crime with the
statement, “I don’t believe it.” Others, citing figures to fortify their
position, point to the prevalence of delinquency and crime as a natural
expectancy from the Negro group.</p>
<p>Criminal statistics have been so consistently unfavorable to Negroes
as to build up a tradition from which common assumptions have had their
birth. Various theories have been set forth to explain the prevalence of
delinquency and crime among Negroes. Some explain Negro criminality as
being the result of heredity; others explain it on a basis of
environment; a combination of heredity and environment offers a
satisfactory explanation to others; while to still others a satisfactory
explanation is offered on a basis of defective mentality,
feeble-mindedness, illiteracy, or racial degeneracy.</p>
<p>Statistical data generally can lead to no other conclusion than the
disproportionate share of delinquency and crime contributed by Negroes.
But untenable conclusions may be given birth on the basis of crude
statistics, or observational and experience data. This discussion,
however, does not propose to deal with the issues involved in the
explanatory viewpoints mentioned above. Neither shall an attempt be made
to refute statements relative to a racial penchant for delinquency and
crime. A thorough-going analysis of the issues and the presentation of
an array of factual data are too involved to be adequately treated in
the limits of this discussion.</p>
<p>Instead, it is proposed to penetrate beyond crude statistics for
Chicago as a whole. Considerable light should be thrown on the problem
of delinquency by making an approach in terms of poor or high-class
neighborhoods, or by types of areas as reflecting differences in
community organization. In this approach the distribution of delinquents
is especially significant in relation to the character of community
life. Moreover, a discussion of delinquency among Negroes in Chicago is
similarly true, in large outline, of the problem in all large centers of
population — especially those above the Mason and Dixon line.</p>
<p>The fact is accepted without reservations that in proportion to their
relative percentage in the total population, Negroes contribute a
disproportionate share of crime and delinquency in Chicago.
Nevertheless, the problem of juvenile delinquency is not a problem of
race but is more intimately bound up with community patterns of behavior
and disorganized conditions within the community. Moreover, delinquency
and crime are not evenly distributed throughout the Negro community but
vary by areas.</p>
<p>Juvenile delinquency among Negroes in Chicago is increasing in
startling proportions. The increase in delinquency is at a much faster
rate than the growth in the Negro population. In the past three decades
the proportion of Negroes to the total population increased from 1.8 per
cent in 1900 to 6.9 per cent in 1930, while the proportion of Negro male
delinquents increased from 3.5 per cent (for a six-year period,
1900-1906) to 21.3 per cent in 1930. Since 1900, then, the Negro
population slightly more then trebled, while the proportion of Negro
male delinquents increased approximately seven-fold. Crime among Negro
male adults, in contrast, has increased in the same span of years only
three-fold, increasing from 7.8 per <span class="pagenum">305</span>
cent in 1900 to 21.7 per cent in 1930 of the total male arrests. This
wide difference in the proportionate increases in delinquency and crime
among Negroes makes it imperative that attention should be focused on
the problem of juvenile delinquency. Why? Because the most startling
increase in delinquency has taken place in the years following the heavy
migration of Negroes into Chicago. If the confusion and disorganization
arising out of the migration means an ever-growing increase in
delinquency among Negroes it will also mean an increase later in adult
crime. Moreover, some attribute the increase in delinquency to the
transplantation of delinquents from the South. The explanation of the
increase, however, is to be found largely in community situations
conducive to delinquency.</p>
<h2 id="the-black-belt-in-chicago">The “Black Belt” in Chicago</h2>
<p>Whenever mention is made of Chicago’s Negro population there
immediately rises in one’s mind an area south of the Loop (the central
business district) in which live the majority of this racial group. The
area is popularly known as the “Black Belt.” This connotation of a Negro
area tends to create a stereotype picture of a homogeneous area of the
city, just as Negroes are popularly conceived to be a homogeneous group.
The Black Belt, to outsiders, is conceived of as a homogeneous area
because it is popularly thought of as a place almost exclusively
inhabited by a definite racial group. It is conceived to be a
homogeneous area just as “Chinatown,” “Jewtown,” and other names are
applied to specific areas to denote the character of the population and
the assumed homogeneity of such area.</p>
<p>Is the Black Belt a homogeneous area? Are Negro communities in
general homogeneous areas? To the close and accurate observer and
student, the popular conception of the homogeneity of the Black Belt is
not true. To such individuals the Black Belt is an area not only of wide
differences but marked extremes. It may be set forth, then, that the
characteristics of Negro areas vary from community to community.
Moreover, within the Black Belt there are widely different social,
economic, and occupational groupings. The Black Belt, therefore, is not
a homogeneous area. Indeed, it is not only an area of contrasts but also
an area of marked extremes.</p>
<p>It is a well known fact that the Negro population of Chicago is
largely concentrated on the South Side, extending from Sixteenth Street
on the North to Sixty-ninth Street on the South, and from Wentworth
Avenue on the West to Cottage Grove Avenue on the East. This area
extends approximately six miles in length and varies from a mile to
mile-and-a-half in width. While the majority of the Negro population
live within this area others live in territory adjacent to the
boundaries outlined. There are, in addition, satellite communities of
Negroes scattered in other sections of the city. The satellite
communities nearest to the Loop are the settlement in the Near North
Side community, the settlement along Lake Street in the Near West Side
community, and the settlement that centers around Maxwell Street, in the
old Ghetto. A definite Negro community exists in Evanston, a suburb of
Chicago immediately to the North. On the southern extreme of Chicago
exists another small but definite Negro community known as Morgan Park.
Other satellite communities on the South Side are Englewood, Lilydale,
Rose-land, and South Chicago.</p>
<p>It was indicated above that Negro areas are not homogeneous
communities. Indeed three major types of areas may be differentiated in
Chicago, namely, Areas of Disorganization, Areas in Transition, and
Organized Negro Communities.</p>
<p>An area of disorganization may be described as an area characterized
more or less by a nondescript and unstable population, an area of
deteriorated physical condition, encroaching business, high degree
mobility, etc. In such an area life is free. There are no censors of
behavior. A common body of tradition and stabilizing community
institutions are negligible.</p>
<p>Organized communities are characterized by more or less common
traditions, relatively stable population, comparative absence of
pathological social conditions. Home ownership is rather common. There
is a general lack of evidence of physical deterioration, and always the
presence of stabilizing community institutions. In such communities
individual behavior is greatly restrained.</p>
<p>The area in transition is an area in flux, where changes are rapid.
Life tends to become free; disorder and confusion compete with order and
organization. More enterprising members of the area seek to escape
encroaching vice, disorder, and physical deterioration by moving into an
organized community.</p>
<p>There is considerable variation in the character and role of
organized Negro communities. The (West) Woodlawn community represents
<span class="pagenum">306</span> the ascendant organized Negro community
in Chicago. The prevalence of home ownership and high level occupational
classes in this community has been set forth by Dr. E. Franklin
Frazier.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Morgan Park, by way of contrast, had
its inception primarily in the need of Negroes to be located near their
work in the semi-exclusive white residences farther west. With the
growth and expansion of Chicago’s Negro population other Negroes joined
this colony in an attempt to escape the high rents and congestion of the
Black Belt. Here, too, home ownership was generally more easily acquired
than, for example, in Woodlawn, Lilydale and Roseland, which tho
different in origin, are similar in character to Morgan Park. But in
South Chicago there is a Negro community based largely on proximity to
work in the steel mills. On the other hand, the Negro inhabitants of
Englewood are those whose initiative enabled them to escape from the
Black Belt. A Negro resident of this community described it as “just
like a big country town.”</p>
<p>The foregoing materials indicate that Negro areas, and the Black Belt
in particular, do not correspond to the popular impression that they are
homogeneous. Does there exist, then, a relationship between the
distribution of Negro delinquents in Chicago and the types of Negro
areas set forth above?</p>
<p>Delinquency among Negroes is not evenly distributed but varies by
mile zone units<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The Negro Family in Chicago. and
also by types of areas. An approach to delinquency in terms of these
units of measurement will reveal fundamental differences in the
character of Negro areas. Moreover, there are not only differences but
marked extremes in these areas.</p>
<p>Negro delinquents are primarily concentrated in Negro areas nearest
to the Loop. The extent of delinquency in these areas is uniformly high
and shows comparatively little difference. Shaw states in general terms
the process operating in these areas. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In each case (referring, by inference, to racial or nationality
population influx into Chicago) the process has been the same. The most
recent immigrants enter and secure a footing by invading the areas of
lowest rank in the deteriorated areas adjacent to the Loop and the large
industrial centers. In time another group enters and displaces the
population ahead of it and pushes it out into what may be called areas
of second settlement.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The growth, concentration and expansion of areas of Negro delinquency
correspond to the process outlined in the quotation above.</p>
<p>An analysis of the places of residence of Negro male delinquents
shows that the distribution at the beginning of the century formed the
nucleus of the present areas of Negro delinquency. A qualifying
statement, however, must be added. Areas of Negro delinquency, in
response to the expansion of business, have been pushed steadily outward
from the Loop.</p>
<p>With the influx of migrants from the South there was a rapid
expansion of the areas in which Negroes lived. The concentration of the
Negro population and of Negro delinquents was much the same as was
indicated for the beginning of the century, except that there was a
decided tendency for a higher degree of concentration in addition to
expansion. For the most part the area in which Negroes lived was an
expansion of the South Side “Black Belt.”</p>
<p>In the three decades that have elapsed since the beginning of the
century the areas of Negro delinquency have greatly expanded. Also, the
proportion of Negro delinquents to the Negro population has greatly
increased. Of the 1,816 individual male delinquents brought before the
Juvenile Court of Cook County (Illinois) during the fiscal year of 1929,
ten to seventeen years of age, 403 were Negroes or 22.2 per cent of the
total male delinquents brought into court. The distribution of the
places of residence of Negro male delinquents for this year shows not
only a high degree of concentration in certain areas but also a marked
indication of movement outward from the Loop.</p>
<p>Classified on a basis of first offenders and recidivists Negro male
delinquents in 1929 subdivided into 271 and 132 cases respectively. The
distribution of these delinquents by mile zones and communities is shown
in Table 1. Wide differences in the percentages by zones may be observed
in this table. While there are some fluctuations in the percentages of
delinquency in the zones, the areas nearest to the Loop in general show
higher percentages than those farther out. Moreover, when compared to
other zones the West Woodlawn community shows a negligible amount of
delinquency. Variations in the percentages of delinquency <span
class="pagenum">307</span> in the mile unit areas have just been
indicated. Still wider and more significant variations, however, may be
observed when the distribution of Negro male delinquents, for 1929, is
considered in relation to types of Negro areas. In this connection, it
may be noted that areas of disorganization, located nearest to the Loop,
have a much higher area percentage of delinquency than areas farther
out. The northern area of the Black Belt has an area rate of 6.5 per
cent, Maxwell Street 6.7 per cent, and the Near North Side 6.0 per cent.
Areas in transition come next in order in percentages of
delinquency.</p>

</table>
<p>The central area of the Black Belt, and the Lake Street area have 4.8
and 4.7 per cent, respectively, of delinquency. Organized Negro
communities have a negligible amount of delinquency or no delinquency
whatsoever. West Woodlawn, with a percentage of 0.8, has the highest
valid organized Negro community per cent of delinquency. Englewood and
Morgan Park, other organized Negro communities, have delinquency
percentages of 1.5 and 2.7 respectively. But the small Negro population,
ten to sixteen years of age, and the negligible number of delinquents
more or less vitiate the validity of these percentages. In contrast to
these organized Negro communities, Lilydale, Roseland, and South Chicago
are totally free from delinquency. This does not mean that these
communities are totally free from the quasi-delinquent behavior.
Instead, it means that delinquent behavior is not serious enough to
justify the filing of delinquent petitions in the Juvenile Court.</p>
<p>The foregoing data reveals rather striking differences in the per
cent of delinquency in different types of Negro areas. But even more
striking is the fact that similar types of areas have almost identical
percentages of delinquency.</p>
<p>Data relating to the geographic distribution of Negro female
delinquents will be summarily set forth due to limited space. The
distribution of Negro female delinquents classified by mile zone units
and by communities reveal that, as with Negro males, there are
differences in the per cent delinquency in radical expansion outward
from the Loop. Moreover, the combining of zonal percentages reveal types
of areas previously discussed. Areas of disorganization have an average
of 3.7 per cent of delinquency. areas in transition have an average of
1.1 per cent, while organized Negro communities have an average of 0.9
per cent. Even so, the latter percentage does not take into account the
organized Negro communities of Roseland, Lilydale, Morgan Park, and
South Chicago, where there are no female delinquents.</p>
<p>What has been set forth relative to the distribution of delinquency
among Negroes is similarly true for delinquency among whites. The
similarity is especially evident in several significant patterns of
delinquency. More specifically, there is a similarity in the pattern of
geographic distribution; in the zonal rates of delinquency; and in the
type of area characterized by delinquency. In short, patterns of
delinquency among Negroes show a similarity to the patterns of
delinquency in non-Negro areas.</p>
<p>It is true that most of the delinquent Negro boys in Chicago are
migrants from the South. Nevertheless, the mere fact of being a migrant
dues not offer an explanation of delinquent behavior. In 1929 the
average Negro boy became delinquent after living in Chicago upwards of
five years. The mean average of length of residence in Chicago for Negro
delinquent boys in that year was eight years, nine months.</p>
<p>Since Negro boys do not become delinquent immediately upon arrival it
indicates the influence of community patterns of behavior in the
development of delinquent careers. Delinquency, then, is not a problem
of race but is more intimately bound up with settlement in areas of
deterioration where delinquent patterns of behavior prevail and where
crime, prostitution, and vice are rampant. Out of this situation the
Negro delinquent emerges.</p>
