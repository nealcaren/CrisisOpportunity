<p><span class="pagenum">8</span> A discussion of the school and its
relation to the vocational life of the Negro, brings us to the
consideration of two of the most vital activities of human life—learning
and earning. These are vital to all; and, to the Negro, who is like all
other folk, the effort to secure, a chance to learn and to earn, has
brought about an heroic change. Within a year, 84,000 Negroes left the
states of South Carolina, Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia and Tennessee. It
is significant that all of these states rank in the lowest third of
states in educational progress in the nation. After years of patient
endurance, the Negro by migrating, has made the problem of education and
vocation, a national, rather than a sectional one.</p>
<p>Now that the problem is nation-wide, its relation to the problems of
the human race in general is becoming more apparent. It is, after all,
simply a phase of the big struggle of the modern era—the struggle of the
Common Man for fullest development. The Negro is regarded as the
commonest of common men in America, and any consideration of his
welfare, in any field of endeavor, is highly in accord with the tendency
of the present age—“appreciation of the genius of the common man.”</p>
<p>No matter how white America may estimate him, the Negro knows that he
has contributed sufficiently toward the building up of this country, to
warrant his claiming a respected place in the nation. Still more than
that, he feels he is a factor in the work of the world. He has reason to
be proud of the fact that, in making these contributions, he has
benefitted other groups in the nation even more than he has his own.
Since we are considering the question of learning and earning, let us
note what the Negro has meant to America along these lines. He has
played a vital part in the educational system. The educational
philosophy of the Negro, Booker T. Washington is the out-standing
contribution, among the contribution of educators, white or black, to
education in America. In the matter of earning, his attitude on the
dignity of labor has done great good in the life of the United States.
After weighing these values, the nation has decided that vocational
education is good and necessary, not only for the black child but for
the white. With the monument—Tuskegee—as a model, trade schools are
everywhere planned, and trade courses are very rapidly being added in
already existing schools. Federal legislation and aid in educational
matters is a modern development, and even there, the effect of this
leader’s teachings is to be noted. For the government is greatly
concerned, not only with raising the general educational standards, but,
is anxious that the vocations, notably agriculture and Domestic Arts, be
closely linked up with schools all over the country. There can be no
doubt that the Negro has greatly influenced the forward movements in
education in this country.</p>
<p>As has happened in other contributions of the Negro to America,
entire good has not been the result where he is concerned. So
tremendously forceful was the philosophy and personality of Washington,
that he swayed the thought of the nation to the extent that other
educational programmes for Negroes were greatly discounted. Institutions
of higher learning in the south experienced a great set-back. Both
interest and funds were transferred to schools giving trade <span
class="pagenum">9</span> training. To meet this situation, other Negro
leaders waged a vigorous campaign of counteraction. It was necessary to
voice and even to agitate the need of the Negro for preparation in the
fields of the sciences and in the liberal and fine arts. Factions of
thought arose among the Negroes themselves over the growing tendency
away from the chance to make contributions to America along lines other
than in the trades. Happily, the contending forces are blending
themselves toward a constructive policy of education which includes all
phases of culture.</p>
<p>White educators are still dazzled, to a large extent, by a one-sided
programme of vocational education for all Negroes. This enthusiasm has
not as yet found full expression in actual practice. This is pointedly
true of the educational officials in the employ of the city and state.
The suspension of effort in vocational education is doubtless due to the
deterring attitude of the white labor unions who greatly fear
competition, in the skilled trades. The actual trade training now given
in the public trade schools in the north and south to Negroes is still
insignificant. For instance, in New York City, a recent study disclosed
the following facts: Out of nearly 2000 workers, not quite 30% were
using trade training. Further, it was found that this training was not
secured in the public trade schools of the city. Not one trade school
graduate came within the scope of the study. The training used was
secured in industry and largely in the unorganized shops. This is almost
an absolute condition in the men’s trades. In this same study, less than
5% of the workers were found to be using advanced technical training,
and this small per cent, had paid for this training in such schools as
Pratt Institute and the Academy of Designs, etc., in the north; and in
such schools as Hampton and Tuskegee, before coming north. Wider studies
would bear out the conclusion that the state systems are doing very
little for Negro education in the vocations.</p>
<p>The public elementary and high schools of the north provide a better
chance for preparation for vocations other than the trades. The same
standard is maintained for both races who, for the most part attend the
same schools. The chief draw-back is the lack of money among the masses
to support the child through a lengthy course in school.</p>
<p>In the south, however, the situation is the other way about. There
the northern philanthropist has taken care, to a great extent, of the
vocational education of the Negro, not only in Hampton and Tuskegee. but
in many other smaller schools throughout the south. This, however, does
not come as it properly should under the state. As far as elementary
education for the Negro in the south is concerned, the reports of the
several state superintendents of education show that the amount of
monies used for the Negro is criminally below that used for whites. This
is having the moral effect of casting scorn upon the lowered rating
which the southern states get in the scale for all states. High school
education for Negro youth in the south may be said to be practically
non-existant as a state function. Negroes are paying state taxes and in
addition paying sums to private Negro colleges for the secondary
education they cannot get from the state. This tragic situation in the
educational system of the south is reflected in the almost
insurmountable handicap met by the migrant youth when he enters the
northern public schools.</p>
<p>From the above, it would seem that educational officials, both north
and south have discrepancies in their work among Negroes which must
eventually be met if the good of the youth of the nation is really the
basis and reason for educational work.</p>
<p>This brings us to a discussion of the second phase of our subject—a
consideration of the vocations in which the Negro is engaged. In the
north, almost any study will show that the largest numbers of Negroes
are engaged in the unskilled processes in industry. It will show him to
be doing the most taxing work in the porter service and in the food
departments on the trains and in the stations of the great railroads. It
will show that he is the laborer on the roads and along the docks; and
in the large manufacturing plants in almost every industry. When strong,
his is the heaviest task; when not so robust, the most menial. Then, he
is the elevator operator, or messenger or porter in the large apartment
and loft buildings throughout the north. For all of the above mentioned
work, he needs only elementary education for use while on the job. This,
however, does not mean that he possesses only such education as he uses;
for it is now a recognized fact that there is a great waste to the
community in the lack of opportunity for the Negro to serve to his
maximum capacity. The entrance of the Negro into the semi-skilled and
skilled trades is generally slight in the north. The greater progress
has been made in the west. However, slight, the fact that entrance has
been made and is being held is significant. If the promotional policy of
the northern employer can be gradually made more favorable, Negro
workers will make a normal progress. W’here merit and examination
systems have prevailed, healthy progress has been noted. This tendency
in industry to force the Negro downward is most noteworthy for a body of
social workers . It is at the root of many of the problems which the
social worker is called upon to help solve. In passing, consider just
one; because of it, the women of the Negro race are compelled to
supplement the low wage of their men. They enter the laundries, shops
and factories, or, continue to labor in the homes of the more fortunate
women, to the neglect of their own. This forced neglect of the home
during the day necessitates undue freedom for the children and lack of
care as to feeding, recreation and discipline. As social workers, many
other problems will immediately come to your mind which arise from this
condition of the Negro mother. One cannot resist the temptation to pause
for a moment and pay tribute to the mothers of the Negro race. And, to
call attention to the service she is rendering the nation in her
struggle against great odds to educate and <span
class="pagenum">10</span> care for one group of the nation’s children.
If the mothers of the race are to be honored bv Federal legislation, the
artist’s imagination will find a more inspiring subject in the modern
Negro mother, self-directed but equally as loyal and tender as the
pitiable and much extolled black mammy of slavery days.</p>
<p>A picture of the vocational life of the Negro in the north is not
complete if only industrial lines are included. In that section. Negroes
are following almost as many vocations as are the whites. The numbers in
any of the skilled callings are perhaps unduly small. The variety is
nevertheless great. They hold not only positions seldom associated with
Negroes, but also attain distinction for the character of the work done.
One would hardly think of a white monthly magazine of national
circulation having as the head of its news service, a colored woman who
rose in the organization from the position of stenographer. Nor, that
one of New York’s largest department stores employs Negro saleswomen,
one of whom is head of stock in her department. One would hardly think
that a busy New York post office station would have as its
superintendent, a colored man who rose from junior clerk, and now has a
force of 30 men under him. Would one usually think of a Negro as being
the assistant manager in one of the important stores of a drug
syndicate? Or, would one imagine that a colored editor-in-chief would
pass upon every sheet of music accepted for publication by a music house
with branches in several countries? One does not usually think of the
scores of Negroes in commercial work or of the many officials of city
and state when one discusses the vocational life of the Negro. To have a
true picture, it is absolutely necessary to touch up the dull gray of
trade life with such high lights as the following: The largest Negro
community in the world—Harlem, is fairly typical as to variety of
occupation. There among the 152,000 Negroes, we find 63 physicians, with
a need for many more. There are 28 dentists who are anxious for students
to study that profession to meet the needs of the future. There are over
900 musicians, mostly entertainers, who are kept busy amusing the
pleasure-seeking crowds at inns, restaurants and theatres. Two hundred
and fifty or more public school teachers find constant employment among
white and colored children. They have risen to positions in the high
schools and on the administrative staffs in the elementary schools. Over
200 nurses are engaged in the service of the city, in clinics, in
tenement house inspection, in public schools and city hospitals. They
are engaged in private duty and in settlement work. There is one private
sanitarium, owned and operated by Negro physicians, where a Negro nurse
has supervision over Negro nurses. One should not forget that the
vocational life of the Negroes of New York includes 50 lawyers with
representatives in the legal employ of the city and state and one in the
state assembly at Albany. One should also bring to mind such positions
as Collector of Internal Revenue of the port of New York and Municipal
Civil Service Commissioner.</p>
<p>Turning to the southern section, progress along business lines is
even more marked. There commercial enterprises along practically every
line have grown up and Negroes have attained wealth and culture as a
result. The Negro is now weighing the cost of this progress in terms of
nerve strain and spiritual drain and is expressing his findings in the
migration mentioned before.</p>
<p>After this brief summary of conditions, north and south, in school
and industry, one realizes that constructive work is under way.
Education is on the increase—the Negro must get his just share. Industry
is becoming more humanized—the Negro must also be regarded in the new
light. The two agencies for human good—the school and industry, must
work together more effectively. It has gradually become apparent that an
additional agent must step in and make the transition from one to the
other less difficult and to keep the spirit of the school alive in
industry. Especially is this necessary in the case of the Negro youth.
They graduate by the hundreds and go to work or trade school or high
school. When the time comes to seek a place in the work of the world,
they meet the greatest difficulty. Lack of innate ability on the part of
the Negro boy or girl is not the underlying cause of these difficulties.
Limited opportunity, a lack of knowledge of the opportunities which
exist and a lack of help in making the necessary adjustments are the
potent factors in the trouble. It appears that one of the greatest needs
of the Negro youth is. not only training in all branches of learning,
according to ability and interest, but adequate coordination and
guidance both in education and work, toward the fullest use of that
training.</p>
<p>An experiment to meet just this need has been tried for the past four
years by the Board of Education in New York City. In the district where
the majority of Negroes live, one teacher was assigned to three
elementary schools to guide the upper grade boys and girls as to choice
in courses in high school and as to work and vocation. At first the work
was carried on in one school, and in the third year expanded to include
three. Improvement in the technique of counselling, led to the giving of
information in group talks or lectures, reserving the individual
interview for those with special * problems. In this way, a great many
more children were reached. Reference to the statistics below will give
some idea of the volume and character of the work. One will notice the
growth in the work of actual guidance with an elimination of relief and
correctional work. This has been accomplished by the co-operation
extended by agencies equipped to do that work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">11</span> In the doing of this experimental
concrete work, a constant effort was made to unearth the larger needs.
Vocational guidance led to the adoption of administrative measures used
successfully with other groups. As will be noted in the following
statements, it led to the inauguration of new and untried work to meet
new situations. Among them are these:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Mental tests, at first used only by counsellor to help in the
diagnosis of educational and vocational problems, were later made the
basis of grading classes, into slow and rapid groups within the grade.
These tests clarified the understanding of teachers as to the wide range
of intelligence among Negro children.</li>
<li>A special class was established outside of school to give
instruction to a special group of over-age and mentally slow girls in
semiskilled domestic work. These girls were tired of school and
expressed but one choice—and for this there were no classes in school.
They must go to work with no preparation. At the end of the course they
were placed and watched over by the teacher, who adjusted wage and other
troubles. One of these girls worked in one place for three years and is
being replaced by this teacher this month in order to secure for her
higher wages.</li>
<li>To meet the demand for trained directors of cafeterias, dietician
and household managers, a completely equipped cafeteria was installed in
the pre-vocational departments in one of the elementary schools. This
work leads to the higher courses in the same lines in the high
schools.</li>
<li>To foster the work of vocational guidance, the North Harlem
Vocational Guidance Committee was formed.</li>
<li>As a result of the need for wider policies in placement and
guidance, the U. S. Department of Labor and the Board of Education made
a survey of the occupations open to Negroes in New York City. This is
now being edited for publication as a government bulletin.</li>
<li>The high school placement department of the Board of Education was
induced to make an equal effort for the Negro youth in its questionnaire
campaign for larger opportunities for the high school pupil. Favorable
advertisement was therein given to the colored child.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a result of this work, the percentage of children going to work
has been steadily reduced and the percentage of successfully guided
pupils is shown in the records being made by these students in lessons
and character rating in the high schools. Sixty-seven per cent, of the
girls guided in the first year of the work are still there and, to
mention only one side, they have attained an average of B+ in
personality and character. There has been a keener interest on the part
of teacher and parent in the future life work and education of the
colored child and the community in general has become a part of the
work. This has been brought about by talks at public meetings of all
kinds, at churches, fraternities, clubs and mothers’ meetings.</p>
<p>This much has been accomplished in one community and its chief value
lies in the light it sheds on the possibilities for other communities.
What has been done in one place can be adapted to another. With such
efforts to improve the methods in learning, and to tie them up to the
efforts to improve the opportunities in the field of earning, there can
be no cause for depression over what can be done to improve the relation
of the school to the vocational life of the Negro child.</p>
