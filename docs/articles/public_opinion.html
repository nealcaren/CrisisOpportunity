<p><span class="pagenum">201</span> In the study of the influence of
public opinion on race relations we are dealing with three important and
highly sensitive elements: the facts upon which this opinion rests, the
theories about these facts, and most important of all, the actions based
on the theories. There are certain physical facts that do not change. It
is not the purpose here to deny or make apologies for the existence of
them, whatever they are. But with respect to these there is a
disposition to assume that the theories about the facts are as
unchanging as the facts themselves; to deny the fact when it contradicts
the theory; and to see facts when they do not exist because the theory
demands them. There are again, generalizations and theories built upon
these assumed and actual facts that do change as society develops, and
as false statements are refuted and new facts come to light. It is on
these theories that the layman is most frequently confounded. Yet upon
these as a basis he is constantly acting.</p>
<p>Let us consider the nature of some of the beliefs commonly met in
public opinion, and at the same time examine their origins and
justifications. Although prejudice and matters of sentiment figure
largely in race relations, it is not only possible but necessary to
study the origins of these beliefs in a purely objective manner. The
growth of feeling in the United States on the question of the Negro is a
natural process. No one seriously believes that the conduct of the two
races in relation to each other is inspired by moral depravity or mere
calculating meanness. No other relations are to be expected on the
present background of beliefs, the one race about the other. The
greatest difficulty in objectively analyzing these beliefs lies in the
fact that we quite generally and naturally regard our views and beliefs,
whatever they are, as founded on eternal and unchanging principles. It
is not often that we care to question the origin of our most firmly
rooted convictions. As James Harvey Robinson points out: ’’We like to
continue to believe what we have been accustomed to accept as true, and
the resentment aroused when doubt is cast upon any of our assumptions,
leads us to seek every manner of excuse for clinging to them. The result
is that most of our so-called reasoning consists in finding arguments
for going on believing as we already do.” Only within recent years have
we begun to study our own thinking processes, and the conditions and
tendencies of our social life. Only recently have we ceased to bow down
with unquestioning acquiescence to the locally familiar as the universal
intention of nature and the ordinance of God. In his attack upon the
particular justifications, theories, explanations, and philosophies
which, wholly without substantiate reason, held women in subjection,
John Stuart Mill makes an observation which applies without a single
modification, to the question of the Negro:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When there is feeling mixed with an opinion, it tends to gain rather
than lose by having a preponderant weight of argument against it. If
accepted as the result of argument, the refutation of the argument might
shake its foundation; but when it rests on feeling the worse it fares in
argumentative contact, the more persuaded its adherents are that their
feeling must have some deeper ground which arguments do not reach, and
while the feeling remains, it is always throwing up new entrenchments to
repair the old.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The analogy between the struggle of women for status and that of the
Negro population, is suspiciously close. Anatomically, mentally, and by
an alleged special act of God, both have been arranged in the scheme of
creation a little lower than supreme man of the particular race making
the comparison. Less than seventy-five years ago women were held
unfitted for college education. Governor Winthrop of Massachusetts
thought such training would certainly induce insanity. Scientists are
still saying, but with a perceptibly weakened sense of conviction, that
women measure five ounces less brain matter than men and lack reasoning
capacity. It is more than an historical accident that Negro suffrage and
woman suffrage were proposed and fought for at the same time. The facts
about woman, as for example, that she is different from man had not
changed in 1920 when universal suffrage was granted. The theories about
the fact, however, had undergone an almost complete revolution.</p>
<p>Some of the familiar and, perhaps, less serious stereotypes of the
Negro will be quickly recognized. For example, that they are boisterous,
over-assertive, lacking in civic consciousness, that they usually carry
razors, shoot craps habitually, are inordinately fond of red, and of
watermelon, are afraid of ghosts and graveyards. Mr. H. L. Mencken in
“The American Credo” has caught up other points: a Negro’s vote may
always be readily bought for a dollar. Every colored cook has a lover
who never works and she feeds him by stealing the best part of every
dish she cooks. Every Negro who went to France with the army has a
liaison with a white woman and won’t look at a colored woman any more.
All Negroes can sing. If one hits a Negro on the head with a cobblestone
the cobblestone will break. All Negroes born South of the Potomac can
play the banjo and are excellent dancers. Whenever a Negro is educated,
he refuses to work and becomes a criminal. Every Negro servant girl
spends at least half of her wages on preparation for taking the kink out
of her hair. All Negro prize fighters marry white women and then
afterwards beat them. All Negroes who show any intelligence are
two-thirds white and the sons of United States Senators. The minute a
Negro gets eight dollars he goes to a dentist and has one of his front
teeth filled with gold. A Negro ball always ends up with a grand
free-for-all fight in which several Negroes are mortally slashed with
razors.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">202</span> Jokes about Negroes, news stories,
anecdotes, gossip, the stage, the motion pictures, the Octavus Roy
Cohen, Hugh Wiley and Irvin S. Cobb type of humorous fiction repeated
with unvarying outline, have helped to build up and crystallize a
fictitious being unlike any Negro. Usually one of two things happens
when a Negro fails to reflect the type: Either he is considered an
exception, or he is “out of his place.” The sources of information
covering this group that might be useful in dispelling many of these
notions are most unfortunate. Few white people read Negro periodicals,
and they come in contact with only a few Negroes, usually their
servants, whom they often seem to regard as omniscient on the aims,
individuals and incidents of the race.</p>
<p>It is this mass of ideas about the Negro, accumulated through
experience, passed on through tradition, embedded in the mores and
absorbed even without conscious attention, with which this paper deals.
These are the background of recognition, of classification, and of
behavior itself. This body of ideas, compounded of time-saving
generalizations, stereotypes, myths, conventions, dogma—what Walter
Lippman in his excellent volume on Public Opinion calls “the picture
within our heads”—determine our attitudes, our way of interpreting
facts, our way even of seeing facts. To quote this author: “Except where
we deliberately keep prejudice in suspense, we do not study a man and
judge him to be bad, . . We see a bad man.”</p>
<p>False notions, if believed, false preconceptions, may control conduct
as effectively as true ones. The moral eruptions observed in the
reckless unrestraint of the mob mind, are from one point of view merely
an acute phase of the same opinion held by those who condone even while
not actually participating in the unpleasant work of the mobs. The
“hoodlums,” those members of the public least able to sublimate their
impulses or restrain their resentments, however acquired, are merely the
executioners of prevailing sentiment. The judgment is passed by the
community. The riots in Washington, Atlanta, Chicago, East St. Louis,
and Omaha are striking examples of the accumulated resentments,
unchallenged mutual beliefs, the one race about the other. If these
beliefs can be made accessible for examination, there is hope that many
of them may be corrected.</p>
<p>There are three cardinal beliefs that may be said to control in one
form or another most of the thinking about Negroes: first, that they are
mentally inferior; second, that they are immoral; and third, that they
are criminal. The alleged innate mental inferiority of the Negro was
once held to be due to a difference in species, then again to a more
recent emergence from primitive life, and finally to backwardness in
ascending the scale of civilization. A natural deduction follows: the
mind of the Negro cannot be improved beyond a given level, so quite
logically adapting his education to his capacities, he is taught mainly
to use his hands. It is most common to hear it advanced as an argument
against the entrance of Negro workmen to skilled trades that they are
not capable of performing tasks which require sustained mental
activity.</p>
<p>On this same theory a Chicago school principal, finding that “colored
children are restive and incapable of abstract thought and must be
continually fed with novel interests and given things to do with their
hands,” altered her curriculum to teach them handicraft instead of
arithmetic and singing instead of grammar. Again, this theory provides
one of the strongest objections to expenditures for Negro education in
states where there are separate schools for Negroes—they are
un-educable.</p>
<p>Tracing the origin of this theory we find that the first Negroes
brought to this country were bond servants on the same footing with
indentured white servants, but it soon developed that permanent
servitude and the slave traffic were highly profitable. The holding of
slaves by a Christian nation demanded some kind of justification—a
conscience balm. If it were ethically wrong for one human being to
enslave another conscience could best be eased by proving that these
slaves were less than human. Accordingly, Biblical arguments founded on
Noah and the ark and his three sons, one of whom was cursed, have
conveniently supplied support for the unscientific. Charles Carroll
wrote a book to establish from Biblical texts the fact that man was
created in the image of God, and since God, as everybody knows, is not a
Negro, it follows that the Negro is not a man. John C. Calhoun, at a
time when Negro slaves were everywhere by intention deprived of the
elements of education, with most unbecoming illogic for a statesman,
ventured that if he could find a Negro capable of giving the syntax of a
Greek verb, he would be disposed to call him human. Thomas Jefferson
observed that a Negro could scarcely be found who was capable of tracing
and comprehending the investigations of Euclid. This was probably true,
but does this justify the formulation of theories that would place this
limitation upon Negroes for all time.</p>
<p>Science helped to bolster up the theories. In 1870, Dr. Jeffries
Wyman of Harvard discovered that the Negro afforded the point “where man
and brute most nearly approached each other.” A. H. Keene, author of an
anthropology still used, found that the black and white human types had
no sanguinary affiliation, and that the black was inferior because it
registered a lower cranial capacity. Dr. Vogt, an eminent German
scientist, deduced the inferiority of the Negro race from the
examination of a single Hottentot woman. In 1906, Dr. Bean, who is
quoted in most discussions on the intelligence of Negroes, seized upon a
theory advanced by Spitzka that brain weights determined genius, and
applied it to 150 white and 150 Negro brains. He announced that he had
found constant and important variations according to race. Under
remarkable circumstances, the accuracy of his findings was tested by
Dr. Franklin P. Mall, an associate, who used the same brains, more
precise instruments. and concealed the racial labels until the
measurements were made. Dr. Mall announced that almost invariably the
Negro brains had been underweighed by Dr. Bean, and the white brains
overweighed. His final result showed no such “differences” as Dr. Bean
reported.</p>
<p>Sir Francis Galton, scientist and the father of Eugenics, based a
rather remarkable conclusion <span class="pagenum">203</span> concerning
the mentality of Negroes upon accounts he had read and heard of the
stupidity of Negro servants in America. Such an unscientific basis would
have been rejected for any of his other conclusions. E.B. Tyler, author
of a text-book on anthropology, assumed from the accounts of European
teachers of children of backward races, that after the age of 12 the
mentality of colored children is arrested: G. Stanley Hall fixed 14 as
the age at which it comes to a partial standstill. Another queer
assumption connects their arrested mentality with sexual
over-development, thus combining two popularly accepted traits. A few
months ago, before a meeting of the Eugenics Education Society in
England, Dr. A.F. Tredgold, M.D., F.R.S., Edinburgh, in an address on
the inheritance of mental qualities cited as his sole proof of the
racial difference in potentiality for development along educational
lines, a comparative racial study made by Dr. M.J. Mayo in the public
schools of New York City. This study was taken as a fair test because
the black and white races were educated side by side. This study has
also been quoted in most discussions of Negro intelligence. Whatever the
facts are, Dr. Mayo’s study could not possibly have discovered them. In
the first place, his study was made from records which had to be
classified according to race by the memory of the teachers extending
back as much as four years. The gradings by which they were measured
were largely subjective with the teachers and admitted by the
investigator himself to be unscientific. Many of the Negro children were
from immigrant families from grossly inferior Southern schools, which
might as reasonably be offered as an explanation of their retardation.
And finally, as evidence of the subjective character of the gradings,
the Negro children made their lowest scores in English and their highest
in Mathematics where biased grades are less possible. In spite of all
this the difference between Negro and white children finally amounted to
no more than four per cent.</p>
<p>Then came the army intelligence tests, which a new school is
insisting are a measure of innate intelligence. Again the Negroes have
been consigned to their familiar station. They were needed in largest
numbers as laborers and fewest in the higher branches of the service;
and by admitted design the lowest classes among whites were freely
eliminated. The Surgeon General’s instructions to the Psychology
Division explicitly state that “in the examination of Negro recruits
camp procedure should be determined by the practical needs of the army,
and the collection of scientific data always incidental to this main
purpose.” Yet the results are being used by some as the primarily
scientific.</p>
<p>Moreover, before judgment can safely be passed upon the finality of
the army intelligence tests in determining the inherent mental
inferiority of Negroes, the following seldom mentioned facts must be
accounted for:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Negroes in most camps were marched in a body to the Beta tests
designed principally for non-English speaking recruits: this was done in
spite of the objection of practically all the camps that these tests
unnaturally limited Negroes. Specifically 65.0 per cent of the Negroes
as compared with 24.7 per cent, of the whites were given the Beta
tests.</li>
<li>Discrimination was further shown when it came to re-examination;
only 20 per cent, of the Negro failures were re-examined, in spite of
the fact that 80.9 per cent, of these improved their score anywhere from
3 to 30 per cent.</li>
<li>The intelligence gap between Southern Negroes with practically no
schools and Negroes living in the North with better educational
facilities is eight points greater than the difference between native
whites and Negroes.</li>
<li>When the native white population of Northern and Southern states,
presumably of the same stock, are compared, a similar difference is
found: for instance, Connecticut with only a 35 per cent, native white
population, registers 30 points higher for white recruits than North
Carolina with a 99 per cent, native-born white population. This is a
difference greater by 50 per cent, than that shown between the native
whites and Negroes.</li>
<li>When the factors of bad schools, mass handling, and to a large
extent, examiners with a prescience concerning Negro mentality are
eliminated, as in the case of Camp Lewis, in a Northwestern section,
Negroes register a median score superior to the white recruits in Camp
Gordon in the South. And finally, (6) the Negroes recruited from New
Mexico registered a score equivalent to the highest rank of whites— the
officers.</li>
</ol>
<p>During slavery when it was the policy to keep Negroes ignorant, and
for a period after emancipation when over 90 per cent, of the Negro
population was illiterate, it could easily be believed that their
illiteracy was unescapable and eternal. But now educability has been
demonstrated: illiteracy has been reduced to 25 per cent.; thousands
have graduated from standard universities; and thousands have entered
the professions. In spite of such facts as these and in spite of its
questionable support, the belief in the innate mental inferiority of the
Negro persists. It tends to crush the Negro’s hope of improvement
through education; it insists that Negro education is useless; it
distorts honest ambition into a desire to avoid hard work, all effort at
honest thinking into impertinence and radicalism, and poise into
arrogance and smartness.</p>
<p>The second cardinal belief to be considered concerns the
constitutional immorality of Negroes. They are sometimes in charity
called unmoral. Frederick L. Hoffman, after a pretentious array of
figures concluded that “all his facts proved that education,
philanthropy, and religion have failed to develop (among the Negroes) an
appreciation of the stem and uncompromising virtues of the Aryan race.”
A prominent member of this Conference, in a volume published in 1910,
gave the stamp of his authority to the belief that “their minds are
filled with that which is carnal, their thoughts are most filthy and
their morals generally beyond description.” He had made his observation
in the most disadvantaged sections of the South, among a group of
Negroes living in enforced ignorance, whose lack of standards. assuming
the accuracy of his observations, could be explained by the same
circumstances of environment that account for this lack among <span
class="pagenum">204</span> mountain whites and among mill workers of
certain sections.</p>
<p>Not long ago, a professor in an Eastern college made the statement
that less than 3 per cent, of the Negro women are virtuous. It got
credence in spite of the fact that it is as impossible of proof as a
similar statement about any other race. A writer in a prominent
sociological magazine a few months ago, after a study of sixteen cases
of desertion in Negro families, deduced a philosophy about the family
life of 12,000,000 Negroes.</p>
<p>The statistical evidence of immorality consists largely of figures on
illegitimacy. Records here are meagre and when found tend to shield
those with greater means of secrecy and knowledge of birth control—the
number of illegitimate mulattoes and the prevalence of venereal
diseases, however, point to a lack of restraint not wholly Negroid. Pure
blacks do not propagate mixed breed and venereal diseases were unknown
among the Negroes imported to this country. But there is a theory to
explain the mulatto population in what is called the “biological urge”
of females of inferior races to mate with males of the superior race.
This places the latter quite innocently on the defensive. There can be
no honest objection to the statement that there are immoral Negroes, in
fact, many such. The rub and the real danger come in the assumption that
this immorality is the result of a constitutional laxity which is
peculiar to Negroes as a race. Here, again, a belief whose foundation is
uncertain, tends to cut off all hope of improvement, and place a scarlet
letter upon those Negroes who are moral when measured by the sternest
code. Here, again, revision of theory will reduce the passionate hatred,
suspicion and jealousy entertained in many sections by white wives and
mothers toward Negro women, and lessen the hazards and actual insults
endured in silence and fear by Negro girls who are lumped together in
the assumption against their morals.</p>
<p>The third cardinal belief is closely allied with the foregoing, that
Negroes are criminal by nature. An alleged peculiar emotional
instability predisposes them to crimes of violence, particularly sex
crimes, and a constitutional character weakness addicts them to petty
thefts. In practically every city with a large Negro population their
crime rate exceeds their proportion in the population. There are Negro
criminals and they are condemned without apology or excuse. But the
bugaboo of the criminal nature of Negroes is unnecessarily severe. A
constitutional criminal nature would most certainly have shown itself
during the Civil War when the protective hand of the master was
withdrawn from his family and the Negro slave stood guard. Yet not a
single case is recorded of the betrayal of that trust. Figures on Negro
crime rarely escape factors completely vitiating for comparative
purposes. Thus, judges, prosecuting attorneys and jury foremen testified
before the Chicago Commission on Race Relations that in Chicago, a
northern city, the unvarying tendency was to arrest and convict Negroes
more readily and on less evidence than whites and give them longer
sentences. The police officers, jurors and court officials are members
of the public and hold the common beliefs about Negro traits. These
Negroes, further, have less money to fight their cases, to escape
detection, to pay fines or even, so far as records go, to bribe
officials.</p>
<p>In one part of New York City, to take one example, there were in one
year, 9 more white persons indicted for rape in the first degree than
there were Negroes even accused of the crime throughout the United
States in four years—and more evidence is required by a New York jury
than by a lynching mob. Or put it this way: a predilection for sex
crimes can scarcely in fairness be assigned to a race with an average
population of eight million, of which number six hundred and
seventy-five have been charged with the crime in a period of thirty
years. Yet this belief, deepened by its association with the most
elemental of human passions, prompts constant and innumerable
perversions and absurdities of conduct. A woman screams and a race riot
brews; a lurid story in the press even when the criminal is in jail, and
the nation’s capitol is in the hands of a mob, murder bent. This sex
motif ran with more or less prominence through each of the riots.</p>
<p>Although these three cardinal beliefs are the most dangerous—there
are others, less important, but worth questioning at least:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>That the Negro race is physically repulsive—one encyclopedia states
that they “emit an odor similar to that of a goat.” This is entertained
less by those whose children were reared by Negro “mammies” than by
those who read about Negroes or are expecting this peculiarity,</li>
<li>That they are constitutionally incapable of resisting the ravages of
white man’s diseases—dying out irredeemably from tuberculosis and
venereal diseases—thus making programs of health improvement hopeless,
although by a little effort their mortality has been reduced 21 per
cent, in 11 years,</li>
<li>That they are “happy-go-lucky” and “thriftless” although they own
farm lands valued at more than two and a half billion, nearly two
million are insured in one large insurance company alone, and one of
every four families owns its home.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, what of the Negroes themselves? What are the effects of all
these beliefs upon them? They cannot escape being assailed on every hand
from early childhood to the end of their lives, with a pervading
intimation of their own inferiority. From the beginning they are
“saturated in a tradition of their own incompetence.” This is a poison,
as one writer puts it, at the very centers of growth. They grow up in
the system inferior not only to the other race, but to their potential
selves. They are in the midst of an advanced social system, of definite
cultural influences, but denied full participation. They may never
escape the insistent implications of their status and race. Attention
and interest are centered upon themselves. They gradually become race
conscious. Opinions and feelings on general questions must always be
filtered through this narrow screen that separates them from their
neighbors. Their opinions are therefore largely a negative
product—either disparagement of difficulties or protest. This enforced
<span class="pagenum">205</span> self-consciousness has developed
strange distortions of conduct, in many, increasing sensitiveness to
sights and fabricating compensations for their inferior station. Natural
impulses and desires are balked. Their conduct becomes unintelligible.
The processes of thought by which opinions are reached and translated
into action are as a result of their isolation, concealed from
outsiders. It has been observed for example, that the “old-time darky”
is passing. This is probably but another way of putting the very real
fact that rapidly developing industrialism, increased literacy,
mobility, and means of communication, and the irresistible trend of
present-day forces that are upsetting the old order and creating new
desires generally, has affected the Negro as they have all others. A
writer in the <em>Century</em> magazine makes an apt observation when he
says that the “peaceful co-existence of ruler and ruled is possible only
where relations between classes remain static for long periods of time.”
This condition is favorable to the growth of traditions, the love of
common things and the manifestations of kindliness and loyalty. This
country’s static conditions were broken up by the Civil War. Those who
picture the Negro of that regime forget that he is being swept along by
the same tide that wrecked the institution of slavery and increased the
tempo of our whole national life. He is, indeed, not the same and it is
inconsistent to expect him to be. The World War brought about another
jolt of traditions, and simultaneously a different outlook on life from
Negroes. Their new desires and behavior are regarded as peculiar and
dangerous. The only reaction is increased measures of restraint which
neither destroy nor change the attitudes.</p>
<p>The back to Africa movement among Negroes is a dramatic demonstration
of their attitude towards their status. This rather absurd dream, to
which more than a million Negroes are contributing funds, is more than a
gesture to escape America. It is a movement of the class lowest down to
fabricate a background and a racial self-respect, to compensate for the
prestige and power they have habitually lacked. The extravagant titles
of the movement like those of the K.K.K. help to clothe little men with
the importance and prestige they otherwise would not have.</p>
<p>The movement is significant further not because of any possibilities
of realization, but because it provides at least a mental relaxation for
hundreds of thousands of Negroes in the picturing of a complete escape
from the constant and unrelenting embarrassments under which they must
live and while living present the air of contentment and of
happiness.</p>
<p>A second effect registers in the mass movements of Negroes from south
to north. Over a half million have moved within the last six years.
Probably 100,000 have moved in the last year. The motives have been both
economic and sentimental. Both desires are evidences of dissatisfaction
and unrest, and these dissatisfactions are in large part the result of
changing standards among the Negroes.</p>
<p>A third effect is flight of quite a different sort. It is that of
leaving the Negro race entirely— ’crossing over” it is called. When a
person of partial Negro descent who is to all appearances
indistinguishable, elects to class himself as a Negro, he voluntarily
assumes all of the limitations placed upon that group. But he is an
equal and an eligible to all forms of association with whites so long as
he forgets the black twig on his family tree. Dr. Homell Hart estimates
this forgetfulness to be occurring in about 25,000 new cases each year.
The subject does not yield itself readily to statistical treatment and
the estimate is probably overstated, but it is a fact that as the ring
around the Negroes grows tighter it is squeezing out many who can easily
escape, and thus beginning a process which the most zealous upholders of
the American dogma have declared could never occur and which they are
most anxious to prevent.</p>
<p>Now it is important to recognize that the most serious clashes of
interest come in that vague and intangible world of feeling where reason
ceases to function. Attitude and opinions have been set and ground into
tradition. Demand for reasons is absurd and infuriating, because they
are perhaps the least important and least convincing factors in a
confirmed attitude. Where there is general agreement on the premises
they are unnecessary but where, as in the case of a less prejudiced
person, the premise is questioned and it is necessary to support one’s
attitude, there is a temptation, rarely avoided, to compensate for
deficiency in fact by embellishing it to fit the feeling. A Negro
becomes a “burly Negro.” Objection to their presence in public meetings
is based on smell. Instead of smiling they “grin” or “expose a gleaming
row of ivory from ear to ear.” The French Military Mission stationed
with the American Expeditionary Army circulated and withdrew under
protest of the French government a clear-cut example of this
disposition. It read in part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>American opinion is unanimous on this (the Negro question) and
permits no discussion of the matter. The kindly spirit which exists in
France for the Negro profoundly wounds Americans who consider it an
infringement of their national dogmas. … We should not sit at the table
with them and they should not be too warmly praised, especially in the
presence of Americans. … The vices of the Negro are a constant menace to
the American who has to repress them sternly. The black American troops
in France have by themselves given rise to as many complaints for
attempted rape as all the rest of the Army.. The black is constantly
being censored for his lack of intelligence and discretion, his lack of
civic and professional conscience. …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a classic example of the effort, rather becomingly covert, to
do something obviously difficult in the absence of a similar cultural
inheritance.</p>
<p>Added to this situation which makes exaggeration necessary is the
fact that this intangible world of feeling holds subjects in which there
is a most pronounced taboo. This not only powerfully intensifies the
feeling itself, but protects it from the assaults of reason and
contradictory fact. When the president of a Woman’s State Federation of
Clubs says, “you all know what we have to fear from Negro men,” no one
questions her. Each is more likely to think of the worst possible cause
of fear. And it does her women hearers perhaps a very little injustice
to say that with such a presupposition against these men, they could
neither interpret nor relate accurately their conduct of any
description. Thus goes the vicious circle.</p>
<p>There are just two instances of the peculiar working of opinion upon
the Negro to which attention will be drawn because while most pervading
and subtle in their effect, they are most frequently overlooked. Negroes
have no more historical continuity than the millions of American whites
who have blended into the American stock from an uncertain origin. This
is the only culture they know or have ever been exposed to. The
circumstances of their lives make it necessary for them to share it and
contribute to it. They know no other in spite of the theories concerning
survivals of African traits. They read the same papers and books, and in
many instances, attend the same schools: They are familiar with the
professed ideals of our nation. It is decidedly difficult on the
background of the same mental content to avoid having the same or at
least similar habits of thinking and similar desires. They have no such
autonomy as makes possible the development of a special culture. It
cannot be improper to inquire how it can ever be possible for them to
follow the advice of many of their friends and advisers to develop here
in America a “culture of their own,” “to be the best possible Negro
rather than an imitation of the white man,” however delightful the
expression sounds as a solution of the problem. Their culture must be
the same or its chances of survival will be small. The state of affairs
in our democracy that would follow the independent development of a
special culture by each racial group in our population can be well
imagined. Where evidences of it have appeared they have been put down
with a stem hand. The program of Americanization was designed to prevent
just such tendencies as are recommended for the Negroes.</p>
<p>Another is just a different shade of the same problem from the point
of view of the Negroes. In the measurement of genius and attainment in
which the Negro population so frequently is pointed out as deficient,
the fact is often ignored that the standards of comparison are set by
the dominant group and at the same time the Negro group is definitely
restricted to a narrower circle of effort. There are few Negro captains
of industry because they may not often break out of the rank of
unskilled labor, and are definitely excluded from supervisory positions.
There are no Negro Napoleons because they may not in the first place be
generals.</p>
<p>On the basis of prevailing beliefs race discriminations are
faultlessly logical. When the practices vary it is because the beliefs
vary. No sensible person would insist that morons should be accorded by
society the liberties of normal individuals. But the fact that it has
been found of temporary convenience to attribute to Negros the mental
and moral qualities of morons is no warrant for permitting the belief to
go unchallenged.</p>
<p>This paper has no intention of denying any clearly demonstrable fact
concerning the Negro population: the questions raised are solely upon
the theories about existing fact which, questionable in themselves, have
blinded the eyes of observers to factual contradictions and prompted
hallucinations of fact to support the theory.</p>
<p>This body of beliefs compounded of this mixture of truth and fiction,
self-interest and passion, forms the structure of public opinion on the
question of the Negro. These beliefs unchallenged not only magnify
themselves and breed others, but react upon the Negro group, distorting
its conduct. This distortion provokes in turn a sterner application of
these beliefs and so on indefinitely, and with each step the isolation
increases, each group building up its own myths and stiffening its, own
group morale. If the myths can be dissolved, if indeed the beliefs, can
be honestly questioned, many of our inhibitions to normal, rational and
ethical conduct will be removed.</p>
