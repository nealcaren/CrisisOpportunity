<p><span class="pagenum">1355</span> The development of a Negro criminal
class after emancipation was to be expected. It is impossible for such a
social revolution to take place without giving rise to a class of men,
who, In the new stress of life, under new responsibilities, would lack
the will and power to make a way, and would consequently sink Into
vagrancy, poverty and crime. Indeed it is astounding that a body of
people whose family life had been so nearly destroyed, whose women had
been forced Into concubinage, whose labor had been enslaved and then set
adrift penniless, that such a nation should in a single generation be
able to point to so many pure homes, so many property-holders, so many
striving law abiding citizens. “The vast majority of the colored
people,” says <em>The Atlanta Constitution</em>, “ would no more commit
heinous crime than would the corresponding white class,” and the
Rev. Dr. Hoss declares in the Nashville <em>Christian Advocate</em>, of
which he is editor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Negroes on the whole have done aston<span
class="pagenum">1356</span>ishingly well. Their record since the war has
been almost as honorable as the one they made while the conflict was
raging. To hold the entire race responsible for the outrages committed
by a few thousands, or a few score thousands of its members, is not just
or right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the town of Palmetto, where the recent disturbance began, It was
only last December that a Methodist conference declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We observe with gratitude the sympathetic and cordial relations
between the white and colored people of this village and community, and
the mutual co-operation between them in Christian work and in civil
life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If one thing is certain, then, It is that the Negro criminal in no
Southern community represents the mass of the race, or can rightly be
mistaken for it. Even In the matter of sexual crime the most prominent
paper in the South declared editorially that “ninety-five per cent.” of
the Negro men “are as respectful toward white women as any people on
earth.” And whenever the terrible crime of rape has been beyond
reasonable doubt proven upon a Negro, he has been found to be among the
most ignorant and degraded of his people. The sexual looseness among the
Negroes themselves, which the nation that taught them now taunts them
with, is slowly but surely disappearing. The rate of illegitimacy among
them is probably less than in Austria or Italy, and it would be still
smaller if law and public opinion In the South gave the defenseless
black girl half the protection It throws about the white girl.</p>
<p>Granting then, as every fair-minded man must, that “in almost all the
elements of civilization the race, as a whole, has made distinct and
gratifying progress,” to quote Dr. W. W. Landrum, Pastor First [white]
Baptist Church of Atlanta, Ga., the question then comes—and this is the
crucial question—What is chiefly responsible for crime among Southern
Negroes, outside the economic effects of emancipation?</p>
<p>The first and greatest cause of Negro crime in the South is the
convict-lease system. States which use their criminals as sources of
revenue in the hands of irresponsible speculators, who herd girls, boys,
men and women promiscuously together without distinction or protection,
who parade chained convicts in public, guarded by staves and pistols,
and then plunge into this abyss of degradation the ignorant little black
boy who steals a chicken or a handful of peanuts—what can such States
expect but a harvest of criminals and prostitutes ? Does it not seem
natural that the State which produced Sam Hose is guilty, as <em>The
Atlanta Constitution</em> declared March 22, of “the burning shame of
converting our penal establishments into schools for crime?” and we are
prepared to hear, notwithstanding the awful revelations of Governor
Atkinson’s prison commission:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Georgia has not even made a beginning yet in the right direction. The
provision of our new penal law will prove the veriest sham. We must get
at the issue straight and separate juvenility from crime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next greatest cause of Negro crime in the South is the attitude
of the courts. The Southern courts have erred in two ways: One, in
treating the crime of whites so leniently that red-handed murderers walk
scot-free and the public has lost faith in methods of justice. The
other, in treating the crimes and misdemeanors of Negroes with such
severity that the lesson of punishment is lost through pity for the
punished. When, therefore, the number of Negroes In Southern penal
institutions is cited as evidence of their lawlessness, students must
not forget this double standard of Justice, which can best be
Illustrated by the following clippings from <em>The Atlanta
Constitution</em> of January 22d:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Egbert Jackson [colored], aged thirteen, was given a sentence of $50,
or ten months In the chain gang for larceny from the house.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The most affecting scene of all was the sentencing of Joe Bedding, a
white man, for the killing of his brother, John Bedding. … Judge —— is a
most tender-hearted man, and heard the prayers and saw the tears, and
tempered justice with moderation, and gave the modern Cain two years in
the penitentiary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course Jackson could pay no such fine and went to the chain
gang.</p>
<p>The third cause of crime is the increasing lawlessness and barbarity
of mobs. Let a Negro be simply accused of any crime from barn-burning to
rape and he is liable to be seized by a mob, given no chance to defend
<span class="pagenum">1357</span> himself, given neither trial, judge
nor jury, and killed. Passing over the acknowledged fact that many
innocent Negroes have thus been murdered, the point that is of greater
gravity is that lawlessness is a direct encouragement to crime. It
shatters the faith of the mass of Negroes in justice; It leads them to
shield criminals; it makes race hatred fiercer; it discourages honest
effort; It transforms horror at crime into sympathy for the tortured
victim; and it binds the hands and lessens the influence of those race
lenders who are striving to preach forbearance and patience and honest
endeavor to their people. It teaches eight million wronged people to
despise a civilization which is not civilized.</p>
<p>Finally, the last cause of Negro crime is the exaggerated and
unnatural separation In the South of the best classes of whites and
blacks. A drawing of the color line, that extends to street-cars,
elevators and cemeteries, which leaves no common ground of meeting, no
medium of communication, no ties of sympathy between two races who live
together and whose Interests are at bottom one—such a discrimination is
more than silly, it is dangerous. It makes It possible for the mass of
whites to misinterpret the aims and aspiration of the Negroes, to
mistake self-reliance for insolence, and condemnation of lynch-law for
sympathy with crime. It makes It possible for the Negroes to believe
that the best people of the South hate and despise them, and express
their antipathy In proscribing them, taunting them and crucifying them.
Such terrible misapprehensions are false, and the sooner some way is
made by which the best elements of both races can sympathize with each
other’s struggles, and in a calm Christian spirit discuss them
together—the sooner such conferences can take place all over the South
the sooner lynch-law will disappear and crime be abated.</p>
