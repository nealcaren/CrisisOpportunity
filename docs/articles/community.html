<p><span class="pagenum">208</span>Personality is regarded in this paper
as the organization of an individual’s habits and behavior patterns in
the process of adjustment to the culture in which he is set, to the
institutions and customs which constitute this culture, and to other
individuals who share this culture. Immediately the question arises as
to the influence, in this adjustment, of the biological factor of race
itself, and what discernible part, if any, it plays in determining the
configuration of personality of an individual or the culture of the
group. The basic assumption of much of the literature regarding the
Negroes in America, scientific and otherwise, is that they represent a
culture which is in itself widely different from that of the
Euro-American culture in which they live. This is implicit in the
frequent and serious references to the success or failure or ineptness
of the members of this group in taking on the white man’s civilization.
The unique situation of the Negroes and their relationship to the
American culture, however, raises questions of considerably wider range
than this local relationship. For it is possible to observe, in the
adjustment experience of this group under well-defined conditions,
something of the process by which individual and group behavior patterns
are conditioned.</p>
<p>There is, in the first place, an important body of historical
material pointing to the fact that in the transplantation of Negroes
from Africa they were <span class="pagenum">209</span> stripped of the
greater part, if not all, of their original culture heritage. Similarly,
the extensive race crossing in this country from the beginning would
most certainly have modified to a considerable extent such unique
biological traits as belonged to a single race. To sociologists who are
or should be realists, however, it is evident that, in dealing with
race, it is necessary to keep in mind always the distinction between
biological and social phenomena, and that what is usually meant by race
has more to do with cultural and social questions than with biological
differentiation.</p>
<p>No discriminating treatment of the Negro in America could fail to
take into account the wide cultural differences existing among them in
America today. But is this cultural base African or Euro-American? Or do
these cultural differences among Negroes represent merely stages of
adjustment to the accepted American standard? And if so, in what sense
is this adjustment different from that manifested by other groups within
the American culture affected by the same external factors of isolation,
local and regional institutions, and codes? It is not possible to speak
of any of the backward groups in American society as being without a
culture; and, since Negroes do not appear to manifest in their present
behavior traces of African culture quite so consistently as they
manifest traces of the culture of the early American frontier, any
measure of changes in personality and group behavior patterns becomes a
measure of the extent to which the social and cultural isolation of
these groups is being broken down. It seems wholly consistent to refer,
in a broad sense, to planes of culture as marking the wide range of
differences observed between individuals and groups which function
together in a complex but common society.</p>
<h2 id="a-peasant-group"><span class="pagenum">210</span>A Peasant
Group</h2>
<p>The observations of this paper are based upon a study of 612 Negro
families located in the rural section of an Alabama county. The area in
which they live is devoted extensively and almost exclusively to cotton
cultivation, and in this activity and concern, which dominates the life
of the group, there have been retained, only slightly modified, most of
the features of the I plantation under the institution of slavery. The
county itself has a long history of cotton cultivation under the
plantation system. The population is over 80 per cent Negro, the few
white inhabitants who are still living in the area studied being for the
most part proprietors or their representatives.</p>
<p>The shift from slavery to the tenant system was more a political than
either social or cultural change. The Negro group is characterized not
only by geographical isolation but by a social and cultural isolation so
marked that many of the values of the past, established in the economy
of slavery, have been retained. They represent a type which can most
readily be described as “folk,” and, since their lives are deeply rooted
in the soil and their range of movement extremely limited, they are,
perhaps, the closest approach to an American peasantry. There is a fixed
accommodation to an economic system and technique which belongs to the
past. There are characteristic folkways and actual folk thought and
expression. The high Negro population proportion, 90 per cent of which
is composed of tenants, both explains and fosters homogeneity. Social
isolation is maintained by the surviving etiquette of race relations of
an earlier period and by a large amount of illiteracy, which shields
them effectively from the influences of those copies by which social
changes <span class="pagenum">211</span>are introduced. This isolation
further restricts the development of the technique of thinking beyond
the requirements of their simple routine of life. There is, most
significantly, a survival of the tradition of the plantation. Patterns
of life, social codes, as well as social attitudes, set in the economy
of slavery, are still effective controls. Moreover, there is in the
social consciousness of the group and in its social life a degree of
organization which does not seem to be based upon African or upon
European culture as much as it is based upon the imperatives of their
peculiar status and role in the early American social system.</p>
<h2 id="changing-folkways">Changing Folkways</h2>
<p>Without some organization of their social life, there could have been
no stability in the relationship of the Negro group to the dominant
society. It would have been as expensive as it would have been tedious
to keep the entire slave population under the regimentation of physical
force. In such a setting the African culture had neither utility nor
place, and there would be ample justification for both master and slave
in discarding it. Park has pointed to the systematic manner in which
these African culture patterns were discarded, and Puckett has supported
this with further observations of the manner in which the southern rural
Negro population, generally, tends to represent the surviving traditions
of an earlier period of American life. They have been the repositories
of certain folkways which have been outgrown by other groups under the
stimulation of more frequent contact and interchange of ways of life.
Their dialect is, in part at least, a survival of the English of the
colonists. Many of the present superstitions and folk beliefs were
borrowed from whites, and even patterns <span class="pagenum">212</span>
of religious emotionalism surviving among the more naive types suggest
the influence of patterns set in an earlier time by the white camp
meetings and revivals.</p>
<p>It would be expected that many of the patterns to which they were
exposed would be imperfectly copied; that in them would be many
crudities of manners, social practices, and behavior below the level of
accepted ideals of the American society then or now; and that for unique
situations there would be developed unique behavior responses, which
eventually would come to be their characteristic folkways. The social
behavior of the dominant society which supported the plantation,
especially in its relation to the Negro slaves, was not always conducive
to the cultivation of standards of morality or ethics or beauty by the
slaves. The organization of life and of values for the Negroes under the
regime of slavery was and had to be’—as is true of all cultures—an
organization which permitted the most satisfying functioning of
individuals in their setting. Viewed in this light, such meaning and
value in the situation as have been given to marriage, the relation of
parents to children, divorce, extramarital relations, illegitimacy,
behavior in emotional crises involving love, death, religion, take on a
new significance. They should help to explain the type of personality
organization developed under the conditions controlling the individuals
included in this study.</p>
<h2 id="the-superior-status-of-woman">The Superior Status of Woman</h2>
<p>In the American culture the structure of the family is the father,
mother, and their children, with the father as head of the group. The
family organization is supported by the institution of marriage, and
social codes govern questions of legitimacy, respectability, and morals.
The Negro families in the situation described <span
class="pagenum">213</span> do not follow this pattern with consistency
or conviction, but this does not mean that they are without organization
or controlling social codes which determine for them what is respectable
and what is normal. The role of the mother is of greater importance than
in the more familiar American pattern. This traces back definitely to
the values established around this role under slavery, when the father
was incidental, had no authority and exercised no control, since the
woman belonged to the master and not to the husband. Not only in the
Negro group but in the white group the role of the Negro mother had a
certain prestige and authority well-known, as the “mammy” tradition
attests.</p>
<p>In the economic organization of the families of the group studied,
the earning power of the woman is only slightly less than that of the
man. This has given to the woman an important measure of independence.
Moreover, the importance of the mother is enhanced as a result of her
advantage, based no doubt upon sex, in dealing with the master class.
Traditionally, the woman could ask greater favors, draw into the family
small but constant sustenance; in crisis situations involving race and
status she has always been able to gain advantage where the appearance
of a male member of the group, except under circumstances of complete
self-defeating humility, would most often prompt punishment for
impudence. These among other factors have combined to give to the woman
in these families a unique status, and one with authority. This
dominance is reflected in many characteristic patterns of behavior.</p>
<h2 id="sex-and-marriage-customs">Sex and Marriage Customs</h2>
<p>There is not only a notable dominance of women in the families
studied, but a marked sexual as well as <span class="pagenum">214</span>
economic independence of the woman. Early marriage is the rule in rural
families generally, but in this group the situation seems to be
strikingly reversed. The importance of the family as an economic unit,
and the * consequent economic value of older children in families, tends
to discourage early marriages on the part both of women and of men. The
economic returns from the long period of nurturing unproductive children
comes only when children are old enough to contribute to the support and
earnings of the family group. Custom and practice recognize this
necessity. Young couples, without capital to employ help and without
children, are seriously handicapped in getting a start. Only family
groups, natural or assembled, can succeed in such a situation. Since to
get established the young people have to be attached to some older
family, parents are reluctant to give to another family either a
daughter or a son. A notable exception to this general rule is the
marriage of a younger girl to a middle-aged man, and most often one with
children by a previous union, who are old enough to work.</p>
<p>The postponement of marriage, which is largely an economic necessity,
gives a different value to the courtship in this group adjustment. One
result of this is a group rationalization as a substitute for the
control of marriage at this active sex period. Sex experimentation, as a
normal incident of this prolonged courtship period, appears to be taken
for granted by the group. It is certain that little surprise is
evidenced when it is known that sexual intimacies have occurred. There
is little deliberate birth control, and where pregnancy follows this
relationship social pressure is not often directed toward compelling the
father to marry or to support the child. The mother’s chances <span
class="pagenum">215</span> of marrying someone other than the father are
not seriously injured.</p>
<p>An incidental value of this lack of a censuring public opinion is the
freedom for children thus born from warping social condemnation. The
group adjustment to this situation entails a widespread and commonly
accepted practice of child adoption, which gives family status to all
children. There are, thus, virtually no orphans. Normally, the child of
an unmarried daughter in a family is treated as if it belongs to the
mother’s parents, and the status of the mother is similar to that of an
older sister.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-family">Types of Family</h2>
<p>The environment has produced not one but many family types which,
however, have numbers of traits in common. It is not immediately
apparent just what have been the predominant influences in shaping their
differences. There are families which are fairly stable and adjusted to
the environment and its social codes.</p>
<p>They have a distinct background, family traditions, a consciousness
of integration, and they are sensitive to certain patterns of
respectability which represent the more reflective moral sentiments of
the group. These families appear among both the educated and uneducated
classes of the population and in varying proportion among owners,
tenants, and croppers.</p>
<p>The frequency in this community of the artificial or quasi-family
seems to warrant their classification as a type. There are, again, those
families which, though not bound by formal sanctions, continue to hold
together over many years under their own internal compulsion. Multiple
marriages are fairly common. <span class="pagenum">216</span>
Intransient family groups seem to be a product of the environment and
are held together over periods by economic and other considerations of
convenience. And just as these types are reflections of the environment
there have been developed physical and psychic adjustments with regard
both to remarriage and to the disposition of children.</p>
<p>Equally important are the families whose organization and sentiments,
though in accord with more advanced ideals of other communities, are in
constant conflict with the dominant patterns of both the white and Negro
local community. Finally, there are those family groups which reflect
definite disorganization as a result of the collapse of the traditional
controls and are yet unable or unwilling to adjust themselves to newer
patterns of relations. All of these are affected in some degree by the
social and cultural transition which they are experiencing.</p>
<p>The numerical distribution of these types of families can be
suggested in these figures: In the 612 households there were 404 married
couples or couples living together in common-law association. There was
no male head in 152, or 25 per cent, of these families; that is, the
male parent was either away or dead. The wife or female head of the
household was absent in 33 of the families. About two-thirds of the
families were normal family groupings. In 231 of the 404 couples married
or living together, the man or woman was for the first time married or
in marital association. In 24 families the husband had been married more
than once and the wife once. In 74 families both man and woman had been
married more than once. There were only two divorced persons who had not
remarried. The community afforded no spinsters and extremely few older
bachelors.</p>
<h2 id="illegitimacy"><span class="pagenum">217</span>Illegitimacy</h2>
<p>The sexual unions resulting in the birth of children without the
legal sanctions are of several types, and these offspring cannot wisely
be grouped together under the single classification of “illegitimate.”
Children of common-law relationships are not illegitimate from the point
of view of the community or, most often, of any objective standard of
stability, for many of these unions are as stable as the legally
sanctioned ones; they sometimes hold together for twenty or thirty
years, or until old age or death of one of these parties, and lack only
the sense of guilt. Again, there are competent, self-sufficient women
who not only desire children but need them as later aids in the struggle
for survival when their strength begins to wane. They want neither the
restriction of a formal marriage contract nor the constant association
with a husband. They get their children not so much through weakness as
through their own deliberate selection of a father.</p>
<p>Sexual unions for pleasure frequently result in children. There is a
term for children born under such circumstances. They are called “stolen
children.” “Stolen children,” observed one mother, “is the best.” A
woman with children, who has been married though later separated from
her husband, may add other children to her family without the benefit of
the formal sanctions. These are referred to as “children by the way.”
There are also the children who result from the deliberate philandering
of young men who “make foolments” on young girls. These are generally
condemned by the community. These children, as circumstance directs, may
be placed with the parents of the mother or father of the child or with
an uncle, <span class="pagenum">218</span> sister, or grandmother. They
are accepted easily into the families and eventually are scarcely
distinguishable from any of the other children. Even if there were
severe condemnation for true “illegitimates,” the confusion introduced
by the group in its adjustment would tend both to mitigate some of the
offenses and to obscure most of them from specific denotation.</p>
<p>The sense of guilt may be noted in some of greater exposure to the
outside culture, but within the community as a whole social censure is
not conspicuous, nor is there any notable loss of status because of
illegitimacy. It does not appear to be regarded as seriously as, for
example, certain artificial forms of birth control or “being closed
out,” which means having all of one’s crop, stock, and tools taken over
for debt.</p>
<p>The church recognizes illegitimacy as “a sin of the mother,” and if
the mother is brought into church meeting with other evidences of “sin,”
like card playing or “frolicking,” she may be “put out of the church,”
but readmission is possible with a solemn promise not to do it again.
Actually, there is less stress placed by the churches upon illegitimacy
as a “social sin” than upon card playing and ball playing.</p>
<p>The sense of shame and injured status follows illegitimacy when the
family has, for one reason or another, become compact and
self-conscious; when there has been exposure to assured standards of a
different and, presumably, higher level, as a result of children
returning from boarding school, or when the family has acquired some
means of education. Such families are most careful about the opinions of
outsiders and resort to the measure of forcing the father of the child
to marry the daughter. Ownership of property tends to restrict
illegitimate relations because of the <span class="pagenum">219</span>
economic complexities introduced and the serious effects upon credit and
leadership in the larger community of looseness in domestic
relations.</p>
<h2 id="separation-and-divorce">Separation and Divorce</h2>
<p>The practice of separation and divorce offers another example of
group adaptation. In about a third of the families the man and woman
were in their first association. Although the amount of remarriage was
great, the number of divorces was extremely small. Voluntary and mutual
separation amounts to divorce. Divorce is one of the legal formalities
introduced from the outside. It is not essential to the functioning of
this group life, since it involves no serious problem of the care of
children or the abandonment of helpless females. The courts, when such
would normally be appealed to, are expensive and extrinsic to the social
life; and since the only contact with them is through officers of the
law, who are more often to be feared than trusted, such alien agencies
are to be avoided. The meaning of divorce, in the sense in which it is
employed in the larger society outside, thus is considerably confused.
Some of the families believe that going from one county to another gives
them the legal right to remarry. Crossing the “line” (Mason and Dixon)
was in some families accepted as effective divorce. A remarried woman
said: “My husband done cross de line, don’t hear nothing. He may be
living or dead. Ain’t dat divorce?”</p>
<p>The simplest interpretation is that the act of separation constitutes
divorce. “They say when you separate from your husband,” said another
woman, “you already ’vorced.” The term “giving a strip,” in common use,
refers to the act of a man or woman writing, or having written for them,
on a piece of paper <span class="pagenum">220</span> the statement that
he or she is divorced, and this stands as final.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I been married three times. My other husband’s bout Wetumpka
somewhere. We jest couldn’t git along, so he revorced me, and me and the
second one fought like cats and dogs. One night he fought me so that I
had to call for help. He left that night and the next day he got the
wagon and moved, and <em>he asked me for a revorce; so I give him a
strip. Marion Wood write it. If I had time I’d ramble round here and
find that strip they sent me from Wetumpka.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were other individuals who believed that the act of remarriage
of their spouse, even though no divorce was secured, conferred upon them
the freedom to marry again: “You see, my other husband, when we
separated, got married again first, so that divorced us.”</p>
<p>A man and woman, aged forty-eight and forty-six, respectively, had
been married eighteen years. It was the second marriage for both
although neither had secured a divorce. Of her first husband, the wife
said: “My husband didn’t leave me, but he got into a little trouble
about some cotton situation and went away. He wanted me to go too, but I
didn’t want to leave my mother. He was gone a long time before I married
again.”</p>
<p>The husband explained: “My wife just went away, and she’s over in
Cecil. I didn’t have to get a divorce, because she had been gone a long
time.”</p>
<p>A man who had been drafted during the World War was positive that he
had been exempted by the government from any further marital
responsibility: “I’se an ex-soldier. They told me when I went to the
army and come back that the government had done ’vorced me, and I didn’t
have to git naire ’vorce.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">221</span> Divorce appears to be necessary only
in those cases in which there is objection of one party to the
separation: “Me and him jest come here to live and she [his wife] ain’t
claim him, so I don’t speck he need a ’vorce.”</p>
<p>It has been pointed out that the families do not act upon a single
standard. Notions of responsibility rest largely upon the social customs
which have grown up with the group as a result of adaptation to the
early social patterns to which they were exposed, and as a result of
exposure to the newer patterns which are being slowly introduced. It is
possible to trace, roughly, some of these standards in terms of
isolation. This is, however, not always a matter of geographical
isolation. In some families old traditions persist virtually unchanged
and permit a stable family situation. In others the conditioning
patterns are of mixed origin; and in still others there is stability on
the basis of newer standards which are more in accord with the culture
of the outside. The present picture in the group studied, however, is
one of confusion, arising from the actual conflict of different ideals
and ways of life. A family may reflect one set of moral ideas regarding
marriage and another regarding divorce, or one regarding legitimacy and
still another regarding extramarital sex relations. Generally speaking,
home ownership and education tend to mark these differences in
standards.</p>
<h2 id="special-group-conventions">Special Group Conventions</h2>
<p>Passing reference should be made to what seems to be conformity to
conventions of the group itself, without reference to outside standards
and ideals. It is not regarded as respectable to demand or even to ask
the father of an unmarried woman’s child to support the <span
class="pagenum">222</span> child. On the other hand, there is indication
of approval if the responsibility of the father is assumed by him
without prompting. Community gossip exercises a measure of control, but
in certain instances in which the question of a child was at issue the
direction of this control was away from marriage, as indicated in the
case of the mother of a young girl who had a child by the son of a
neighbor and who refused to let her daughter marry the boy, in spite of
mutual desires, because the mother of the boy had made uncomplimentary
remarks about the girl. It is less respectable to force a marriage than
to be deserted after a forced marriage.</p>
<p>It would be a great mistake to assume from practices which, on the
surface, seem uncontrolled that there are no standards and no controls.
There is a strong conformity to those group standards which are
distilled from hard experience rather than from the abstractions of
moral philosophy. There are limits to the sex freedom tolerated, and
when these limits are reached the violators feel unmistakably the
disapproval of the group. Social disapproval is certain and severe upon
the men who abuse the social arrangement by refusing to assume any
responsibility whatever. The community places its disapproval upon “fast
women.” A fast woman is not a prostitute but a woman who maliciously and
to no useful end steals other women’s men and, through the men, the
earnings to which another woman has made an important contribution.
There is, on the other hand, approval of alliances, whether legal or
not, which offer the highest chances of survival in the environment. A
mother who had never married said: “I ain’t want no husband myself, and
I don’t care if Alder [her daughter] marries er no. Willie [father of
Alder’s child] is a social man. Alder’s <span class="pagenum">223</span>
father asked me to marry him, but I tole him I don’ want no husband.”
Married life imposes certain obligations which are, in the feeling of
this element of the community, more binding than necessary or
practicable. It gives license to mistreatment; it imposes upon women the
risk of unprofitable husbands.</p>
<p>Gambling is condemned as a vice. This is no doubt a result of the
influence of the church with its prohibition of indulgence in certain
forms of worldliness. Baseball is likewise under the ban and secular
“frolics.” It is a mark of greatest respectability when it can be said
that no member of a family has been in jail. Still another practice
which has the disapproval of the group is begging. This is different
from mutual assistance between neighbors or from the aspect of
supplication necessary at times to secure what is due them from the
white folks. To be able to say, “I don’t ’cep charity from Nobody,” is
an indication of highest self-commendation. At first the rural Negroes
who went North in the migration of 1918 refused to seek charity, and the
Red Cross in this area had first to convince them that the aid offered
to them in real distress was not the unrespectable kind of charity. It
is only when these Negroes become sophisticated that they lose their
“morality” and become content to live on the agencies. Work is a virtue
and is respectable, although there are lazy members of the group. A
woman is justified in leaving a husband who is lazy and need not give
any other explanation.</p>
<p>The suggestion here is that, despite the unevenness of life, the
amount of sexual freedom, the frequency of separation and realignment of
families, the number of children born out of formal wedlock, there are
certain conventional codes and continuities consistent with the
essential routine of their lives, and that these <span
class="pagenum">224</span> conventions and codes represent a form of
organization adapted to their total environment. Where the social
processes in these respects are so largely unconscious or are accepted
as a survival measure, the relations may reasonably be presumed to have
a structure, whatever its foundation and whatever its explanation. The
marriage relation under slavery, despite its lack of the sanctions of
the dominant society, had some seriousness of purpose for the slaves and
was forced to accommodate itself to the convenience of the institution
of slavery with respect to continuity, fertility, selection of mates,
changes of mates, the quasi-eugenic demands of the institution with
respect to breeding, and similar circumstances.</p>
<h2 id="factors-of-change">Factors of Change</h2>
<p>It is scarcely conceivable that the isolation of this group at any
point could be so complete as to prevent the introduction of different
sentiments and interpretations of these relations in the light of more
advanced conceptions of life and social relations. The group as a whole
thus ranges from the almost total acceptance of the original sanctions
of the group under the slave tradition to the fullest acceptance of the
newest codes introduced from the outside, whether thoroughly
comprehended or not. Disorganization is most acute where these sanctions
are in conflict and the individuals are firmly rooted in neither of the
patterns of life organizations.</p>
<p>The cultural isolation of this group is being broken down as a result
of a number of social factors. One of these is the status of home or
farm ownership, another is migration, and still another is education.
Ownership, for example, alters the organization of the family and <span
class="pagenum">225</span> gives a different stress of values. Marriage
and legitimacy more easily go with ownership status because the related
and supporting structure of property rights and protection belongs to
the outside culture. Ownership imposes a check upon adoption and upon
the irregular organization of family groups. It fosters family
traditions.</p>
<p>Members of the community who leave it and return may weaken the old
controls by their superiority to them, disregard of them, or even abuse
of them. They may, as they often do, introduce new ideas which are
beneficial. It is because of this weakening of the old controls which
have operated traditionally in the interracial alignment that the white
proprietors dislike Negroes from the outside, or returned migrants. Such
Negroes put “dangerous whims” into the heads of the plantation Negroes
who are fixed parts of the community. One unquestionable value of the
changing ministry of the Methodist church is to be found in the contact
afforded the community through them with the outside world.</p>
<p>Most important of these factors, however, is education. Whether as a
result of the elementary schools introduced or of returned children who
were educated outside or of new teachers sent in from the outside, the
changes become measurable. It is one of the most striking observations
of this study that on the basis of parents’ education, group differences
among the families could be noted with respect to size of family,
economic self-sufficiency, the number of still-births and miscarriages,
infant mortality, the amount of sickness, the incidence of venereal
infection, attitudes toward themselves and toward life. With respect to
all of these, save one, there is a distinct correlation, indicating the
correspondence of numbers of years <span class="pagenum">226</span> of
schooling with degrees of approximation to the approved standards of the
accepted American culture.</p>
<p>The exception noted is the factor of earnings. In this case the
illiterates earn least, those with most education (that is, more than
five years of schooling) rank next, and those with little education rank
highest. The irony of the situation lies in the fact that under the
archaic economic system, with its distinct racial conflicts and
controls, those with little education are most completely accommodated.
The illiterates, who number over a third of the adult population, are
too dull to take advantage even of their simple surroundings, and those
with enough education to develop independence have to overcome the
weight of the outmoded plantation system and a strong implication of the
unnecessity of effective literacy. This attitude toward education is
also a part of the heritage.</p>
<p>The literate Negroes seldom conquer their economic environment. What
most frequently happens is that those who are not forced to conform to
the common pattern get into personal difficulties with the white
proprietorial class or are taken in by the law or migrate. A Negro who
can figure well enough to challenge the landowner’s account, if he
discovers it to be incorrect, or who may resent the high credit rates at
the commissary or who has sufficient independence to market his own
cotton is a disturbing influence. An economic technique which keeps
virtually the whole population as tenants, in debt and perennially
dependent, which resists innovations, would scarcely be expected to
place a premium upon advanced education.</p>
<p>The process of change in the community may be noted now in the
gradual modification of family life and in the transfer of a phase of
dependence from white folks to children. The children, rather than the
family’s <span class="pagenum">227</span> white folks, are now being
entrusted with the keeping of the family ages because being young “their
minds are strong.” These children can read the letters that occasionally
come in from relatives or friends in distant parts and bring home gossip
from the school. The children thus become a link with the new culture.
New notions of sanitation and hygiene percolate into the old homes,
giving a new and forewarning meaning to contagion, infection, open
wells, and disease symptoms and numerous other hazards which have been
locked up in old habits. The slow rate of transition through education,
however, seems to be attributed as much to the inadequacy of the present
local elementary schools as to the inability or unwillingness of the
older members of the group to abandon their traditional ways.</p>
