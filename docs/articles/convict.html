<p><span class="pagenum">19</span> The Convict Lease System and Lynch
Law are twin infamies which flourish hand in hand in many of the United
States. They are the two great outgrowths and results of the class
legislation under which our people suffer to-day. Alabama, Arkansas,
Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Washington claim to be too poor
to maintain state convicts within prison walls. Hence the convicts are
leased out to work for railway contractors, mining companies and those
who farm large plantations. These companies assume charge of the
convicts, work them as cheap labor and pay the states a handsome revenue
for their labor. Nine-tenths of these convicts are Negroes. There are
two reasons for this.</p>
<p>⁣(1) The religious, moral and philanthropic forces of the country –
all the agencies which tend to uplift and reclaim the degraded and
ignorant, are in the hands of the Anglo-Saxon. Not only has very little
effort been made by these forces to reclaim the Negro from the
ignorance, immorality and shiftlessness with which he is charged, but he
has always been and is now rigidly excluded from the enjoyment of those
elevating influences toward which he felt voluntarily drawn. In
communities where Negro population is largest and these counteracting
influences most needed, the doors of churches, schools, concert halls,
lecture rooms, Young men’s Christian Associations, and Women’s Christian
Temperance Unions, have always been and are now closed to the Negro who
enters on his own responsibility. Only as a servant or inferior being
placed in one corner is he admitted. The white Christian and moral <span
class="pagenum">20</span>influences have not only done little to prevent
the Negro becoming a criminal, but they have deliberately shut him out
of everything which tends to make for good citizenship.</p>
<p>To have Negro blood in the veins makes one unworthy of consideration,
a social outcast, a leper, even in the church. Two Negro Baptist
Ministers, Rev. John Frank, the pastor of the largest colored church in
Louisville, Ky., and Rev. C. H. Parish, President of Extein Northern
University at Cane Spring, Ky., were in the city of Nashville,
Tennessee, in May when the Southern Baptist Convention was in session.
They visited the meeting and took seats in the body of the church. At
the request of the Association, a policeman was called and escorted
these men out because they would not take the seats set apart for
colored persons in the back part of the Tabernacle. Both these men are
scholarly, of good moral character, and members of the Baptist
denomination. But they were Negroes, and that eclipsed everything else.
This spirit is even more rampant in the more remote, densely populated
plantation districts. The Negro is shut out and ignored, left to grow up
in ignorance and vice. Only in the gambling dens and saloons does he
meet any sort of welcome. What wonder that he falls into crime?</p>
<p>⁣(2) The second reason our race furnishes so large a share of the
convicts is that the judges, juries and other officials of the courts
are white men who share these prejudices. They also make the laws. It is
wholly in their power to extend clemency to white criminals and mete
severe punishment to black criminals for the same or lesser crimes. The
Negro criminals are mostly ignorant, poor and friendless. Possessing
neither money to employ lawyers nor influential friends, they are
sentenced in large numbers to long terms of imprisonment for petty
crimes. The <em>People’s Advocate</em>, a Negro journal, of Atlanta,
Georgia, has the following observation on the prison showing of that
state for 1892. “It is an astounding fact that 90 per cent. of the
state’s convicts are colored; 194 white males and 2 white females; 1,710
colored males and 44 colored females. Is <span
class="pagenum">21</span>it possible that Georgia is so color prejudiced
that she won’t convict her white law-breakers. Yes, it is just so, but
we hope for a better day.”</p>
<p>George W. Cable, author of <em>The Grandissimes</em>, Dr. Sevier,
etc., in a paper on “The Convict Lease System,” read before a Prison
Congress in Kentucky says: “In the Georgia penitentiary in 1880, in a
total of nearly 1200 convicts, only 22 prisoners were serving as low a
term as one year, only 52 others as low as two years, only 76 others as
low a term as three years; while those who were under sentences of ten
years and <em>over</em> numbered 538, although ten years, as the rolls
show, is the <em>utmost</em> length of time that a convict can be
expected to remain alive in a Georgia penetentiary. Six men were under
sentence for simple assault and battery — mere fisticuffing — one of two
years, two of five years, one of six years, one of seven and one of
eight. For larceny, three men were serving under sentence of twenty
years, five were sentenced each for fifteen years; one for fourteen
years, six for twelve years; thirty-five for ten years, and 172 from one
year up to nine years. In other words, a large majority of these 1200
convicts had for simple stealing, without breaking in or violence, been
virtually condemned to be worked and misused to death. One man was under
a twenty years’ sentence for hog-stealing. Twelve men were sentenced to
the South Carolina penetentiary on no other finding but a misdemeanor
commonly atoned for by a fine of a few dollars, and which thousands of
the state’s inhabitants (white) are constantly committing with impunity
— the carrying of concealed weapons. Fifteen others were sentenced for
mere assault and battery. In Louisiana a man was sentenced to the
penetentiary for 12 months for stealing five dollars worth of
gunnysacks! Out of 2378 convicts in the Texas prison in 1882, only two
were under sentence of less than two years length, and 509 of these were
under twenty years of age. Mississippi’s penetentiary roll for the same
year showed 70 convicts between the ages of 12 and 18 years of age
serving long terms. Tennessee showed 12 boys under 18 years of age,
under sentences of more than a year; and the North <span
class="pagenum">22</span>Carolina penetentiary had 234 convicts under 20
years of age serving long terms.”</p>
<p>Mr. Cable goes on to say in another part of his admirable paper: “In
the Georgia convict force only 15 were whites among 215 who were under
sentences of more than ten years.” What is true of Georgia is true of
the convict lease system everywhere. The details of vice, cruelty and
death thus fostered by the states whose treasuries are enriched thereby,
equals anything from Siberia. Men, women and children are herded
together like cattle in the filthiest quarters and chained together
while at work. The Chicago <em>Inter-Ocean</em> recently printed an
interview with a young colored woman who was sentenced six months to the
convict farm in Mississippi for fighting. The costs etc., lengthened the
time to 18 months. During her imprisonment she gave birth to two
children, but lost the first one from premature confinement, caused by
being tied up by the thumbs and punished for failure to do a full day’s
work. She and other women testified that they were forced to criminal
intimacy with the guards and cook to get food to eat.</p>
<p>Correspondence to the Washington D.C. <em>Evening Star</em> dated
Sept. 27, 1892, on this same subject has the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fact that the system puts a large number of criminals afloat in
the community from the numerous escapes is not its worst feature. The
same report shows that the mortality is fearful in the camps. In one
camp it is stated that the mortality is 10 per cent per month, and in
another even more than that. In these camps men and women are found
chained together, and from twenty to twenty-five children have been born
in captivity in the convicts’ camps.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Some further facts are cited with reference to the system in use in
Tennessee. The testimony of a guard at the Coal Creek prison in
Tennessee shows that prisoners, black and dirty from their work in the
mines, were put into their rooms in the stockades without an opportunity
to change their clothing or sufficient opportunity for cleanliness.
Convicts were whipped, a man standing at the head and another at the
feet, while a third applied the lash with both hands. Men who failed to
perform their task of mining from two to four tons of coal per day were
fastened to planks by the feet, then bent over a barrel and fastened by
the hands on the other side, stripped and beaten with a strap. Out of
the fifty convicts worked in the mines <span
class="pagenum">23</span>from one to eight were whipped per day in this
manner. There was scarcely a day, according to the testimony of the
witness, James Frazier, in which one or more were not flogged in this
manner for failure to perform their day’s task. The work in the mines
was difficult and the air sometimes so bad that the men fell insensible
and had to be hauled out. Their beds he describes as “dirty, black and
nasty looking.” One of the convicts, testifying as to the kind of food
given them, said that the pea soup was made from peas containing weevils
and added: “I have got a spoonful of weevils off a cup of soup.” In many
cases convicts were forced to work in water six inches deep for weeks at
a time getting out coal with one-fourth of the air necessary for a
healthy man to live in, forced to drink water from stagnant pools when
mountain springs were just outside of the stockades, and the reports of
the prison officials showing large numbers killed in attempting to
escape.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The defense of this prison is based wholly upon its economy to the
state. It is argued that it would cost large sums of money to build
penitentiaries in which to confine and work the prisoners as is done in
the Northern States, while the lease system brings the state a revenue
and relieves it of the cost of building and maintaining prisons. The
fact that the convicts labor is in this way brought into direct
competition with free labor does not seem to be taken into account. The
contractors, who get these laborers for 30 or 40 cents per day, can
drive out of the market the man who employs free labor at $1 a day.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This condition of affairs briefly alluded to in detail in Tennessee
and Georgia exists in other Southern States. In North Carolina the same
system exists, except that only able-bodied convicts are farmed out. The
death rates among the convicts is reported as greater than the death
rate of New Orleans in the greatest yellow fever epidemic ever known. In
Alabama a new warden with his natural instincts unblunted by familiarity
with the situation wrote of it: “The system is a better training school
for criminals than any of the dens of iniquity in our large cities. The
system is a disgrace to the state and the reproach of the civilization
and Christian sentiment of the age.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every Negro so sentenced not only means able-bodied men to swell the
state’s number of slaves, but every Negro so convicted is thereby
<em>disfranchised</em>.</p>
<p>It has been shown that numbers of Negro youths are sentenced to these
penetentiaries every year and there <span
class="pagenum">24</span>mingle with the hardened criminals of all ages
and both sexes. The execution of law does not cease with the
incarceration of those of tender years for petty crimes. In the state of
South Carolina last year Mildred Brown, a little thirteen year old
colored girl was found guilty of murder in the first degree on the
charge of poisoning a little white infant that she nursed. She was
sentenced to be hanged. The Governor refused to commute her sentence,
and on October 7th, 1892, at Columbia, South Carolina, she was hanged on
the gallows. This made the second colored female hanged in that state
within one month. Although tried, and in rare cases convicted for murder
and other crimes, no white girl in this country ever met the same fate.
The state of Alabama in the same year hanged a ten year old Negro boy.
He was charged with the murder of a peddler.</p>
