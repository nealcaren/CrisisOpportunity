<h2 id="statement-of-facts">Statement of Facts</h2>
<p>Some of the important facts about the Negroes of the nation in 1923
are: they are increasing numerically, they are a forward looking group
and are making rapid progress. On the other hand, there is still a great
deal of ignorance, inefficiency, poverty, and general backwardness to be
found among them. As a group the Negroes of the country are optimistic,
their confidence in themselves is increasing, they are trying to do the
same things, make the same achievements which the white people have
made. This is not a slavish imitation of the white man; it is a most
serious effort to master modern civilization and to make it his own.</p>
<p>The 1920 census reported the Negro population of the nation to be
10,463,131, or 9.9 per cent of the total population. The proportion of
Negroes in the total population is steadily decreasing mainly because of
the rapid increase of the white population through immigration. The
Negroes, however, constitute a considerable element of the population
and the indications are that for a great many decades to come they will
continue to do so.</p>
<p>The rate of increase of the Negro population, 6.5 per cent in 1920,
as compared with 11.2 per cent increase for 1910 would appear to
indicate that the Negro population is rapidly approaching a stationary
state. It is of interest to note that for the decade 1860-1870 the rate
of increase was 9.9 per cent, almost as low as for 1920.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The
rate of increase for Negroes, 1850-1920, shows great fluctuation, part
of which is explained by census revisions. The greater part of the
difference between the rates of increase in 1850, 1860 and 1870 is due
to the sudden change in the status of the Negro as a result of
emancipation. The Negro was released from the soil and permitted to move
about with a freedom and facility which he had not heretofore possessed.
A somewhat similar state existed in the five years, 1916-1920. During
this period there occurred the greatest economic and social change which
the Negro had experienced since emancipation. This change was almost as
sudden as that of emancipation and was accompanied by an even greater
movement of population. The results in both periods because of this
sudden change and great movement of population were that many Negroes
were probably not enumerated in the census and that birth and death
rates were both affected.</p>

<p>The indications are that the migrations of 1916-1920 and of 1922-1923
will probably not have as great an affect on the change of the
proportion of Negroes North and South as is popularly supposed. What is
happening is that while there is a rapid increase of the number of
Negroes in the North the total number of Negroes remaining in the South
continues to increase. This total in 1910 was 8,749,427 and in 1920,
8,912,231.</p>
<p>The movement of Negroes to the North is not to this section as a
whole but rather to a few industrial centers. It is found that
1,139,505, or 73.4 per cent of the Negro population of the North is
living in ten industrial districts, as follows:</p>

<p>The so-called migration to the North is a part of the movement of
Negroes to cities, both North and South. The increase of Negro urban
population in the South, 1910-1920, was 396,444, or 56,000 more than the
increase for the same period in the number of Negroes in the North from
the South, 340,260. More than one-third, 34.0 per cent, of the total
Negro population is living in urban territory. The census reports show
an actual decrease of 234,876, or 3.4 per cent, in the Negro rural
population of the country. In 1910 the number of Negroes reported as
living in rural territory was 7,138,534. In 1920 the number thus living
was reported to be 6,903,658.</p>

<p>It would appear that the tendency for the concentration of Negroes in
the black belt sections of the South is decreasing. The census reports
show that these sections of the South in which there is a more rapid
increase of Negroes do not correspond with the area of maximum density
of Negro population. The number of counties in the South having half or
more of their population Negroes is decreasing. _ There is also a
decrease in the total Negro population of these counties. In 186U there
were in the South 244 counties in which half or more of the population
were Negroes. The number of these counties in 1880 was 300; in 1890 the
number was 282; in 1900 the number was 286; in 1910 the number was 264;
and in 1920 the number was 219; that is the greatest number of these
counties was in 1880 and the smallest number was in 1920. The population
of the counties having half or more of their population Negroes was in
1880, 3,392,235; in 1890, 3,555,970; in 1900, 4,057,619; in 1910,
3,932,484; and in 1920, 3,242,439.</p>
<p>The white population of the South is increasing at a more rapid rate
than the Negro population with a result that the proportion of Negroes
in the population of the South is decreasing. In 1900 the percentage of
Negroes in the South’s population was 32.3; in 1910, 29.8; and in 1920,
27.0. There are now no cities of importance in the United States in
which 50 per cent or more of their population are Negroes. It is very
probable that the 1930 census will show that South Carolina and
Mississippi will have a majority of whites. In 1920 Negroes constituted
51.4 per cent of the population of South Carolina and 52.2 per cent of
the population of Mississippi.</p>
<p>The most recent available information indicates that the health of
Negroes is improving. The death rates for Negroes are considerably
higher than those for whites. Mortality statistics indicate that the
death rates for both races are decreasing.</p>

<p>It appears that there is a greater decrease in the death rates for
Negroes in recent years than that for whites. The decline of the rate
for whites in the registration area in the period 1910-1921 was 22.7 per
cent; that for Negroes, 33.8 per cent. The death rate for Negroes now is
about what it was for whites twenty years ago. The rate for whites in
1900 was 17.1 per cent; that for Negroes in 1921 was 16.0 per cent. It
further appears that at any one time the death rate among Negroes
compares favorably with that of whites in many foreign countries as, for
example, in 1910 the death rate was for Hungary, 23.6 per cent; Rumania,
24.8 per cent; Spain, 23.3 per cent; Austria, 21.3 per cent; Negroes of
the United States, 24.2 per cent.</p>
<p>Life insurance tables show that there is a broadening of the lifespan
of insured Negroes. The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company recently
stated that in the two years, 1911–1912, the expected life-span of the
colored male policyholders at age ten was 41.32 years. In 1922, the
expectation was 46.74 years, an increase of about 5 1/2 years or 13.1
per cent. The increase of life expectancy during the same period for
insured white males was 6.3 years or 13.8 per cent. The life expectancy
for colored female policyholders at age ten increased from 41.30 years
in 1911-1912 to 46.07 years in 1922 which is a gain of about 5 years or
11.5 per cent and is a better record than the increase, 3.8 years or 7.5
per cent for insured white females. Thk indicates that better economic
conditions and better living conditions and changes in life and labor
which have recently come to the Negro are tending to increase his
lifespan.</p>
<p>When compared with the wealth of the nation the wealth of Negroes is
small. Since their emancipation, however, the property accumulation of
Negroes has rapidly increased from some $20,000,000 in 1866 to over
$1,500,000,000 in 1923. Through purchases and increases in value, their
property holdings are increasing at the rate of about $50,000,000 per
year. The lands which they now own amount to more than 22,000,000 acres
or over 34,000 square miles, an area greater than that of the five New
England States, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut and
Rhode Island. Home owning is an important phase of property
accumulation. It is estimated that Negroes now own over six hundred
thousand homes; that is, one home out of every four which they have
established is owned. This is a remarkable showing and has great
significance for the future of the race. It is safe to say that any
people, starting with a handicap of poverty and ignorance, who can in
fifty years become owners of one-fourth of all the homes which they
occupy are making progress along those lines which make for a high
degree of citizenship.</p>
<p>With respect to the education of the Negro it is found that there is
much improvement. The illiteracy of the group has decreased from 70.0
per cent in 1880 to 22.9 per cent in 1920. Negro education in 1923 shows
great progress when compared with that of former years. This is true
with respect to equipment and facilities both in public schools and
secondary’ schools and in colleges. Formerly the same schools did work
from the kindergarten to college and professional training. The tendency
now is to confine a particular grade of work to schools of that grade;
that is, elementary work to elementary schools, secondary work to
secondary schools, and collegiate work to colleges. Although during the
past fifty’ years there has been <span class="pagenum">43</span> great
progress in Negro education the equipment and facilities in Negro
schools today are on the whole far below those in white schools. A large
part of the rural schools in the South are still without school
buildings and the average length of the terms of many of these schools
is still from three to five months. Although the Negroes constitute
about 11 per cent of the total population of the country, only a little
more than 2 per cent of the $1,300,000,000 expended annually for
education is spent upon them.</p>
<p>The Negroes as a group are rising in the scale of occupations and now
have a better economic footing than at any time since their
emancipation. The Negroes in 1923 are found in many and varied
occupations; in fact, there are very few, if any, occupations or grades
of occupations in which there are not some Negroes. The distribution of
Negroes ten years and over with reference to occupations as reported in
the 1920 census is shown in the following table:</p>

<h3 id="the-negro-and-civil-rights">The Negro and Civil Rights</h3>
<p>The status of the Negro with respect to civil rights in 1923 is that
he must look to the several states for whatever civil rights he wishes
to secure under the guarantee of the Constitution through the 14th
Amendment. After the United States Supreme Court in 1883 declared the
Civil Rights Bill of 1875 unconstitutional, the burden of securing for
the Negroes equality of accommodations in public places was placed upon
the states. Since that time seventeen states outside of the South have
adopted civil rights bills which practically copied the Civil Rights
Bill of 1875. These states are Connecticut, Iowa, New Jersey, Ohio,
Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota,
Nebraska, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, Washington, Wisconsin
and California.</p>
<p>Laws for the separation of races in public conveyances are now in
force in Tennessee. Florida, Mississippi, Texas, Louisiana, Alabama,
Kentucky, Arkansas, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia,
Maryland and Oklahoma.</p>
<p>Separate school laws with respect to races are now in force in
Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South
Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia.</p>
<p>Laws to restrict the suffrage with special application to the Negro
are now in force in Mississippi, South Carolina, Louisiana, North
Carolina, Alabama, Virginia, Georgia and Oklahoma.</p>
<p>The laws restricting suffrage appear to operate to disfranchise both
whites and Negroes. An indication of this is shown by a comparison of
the votes cast in Southern States in the 1920 presidential election with
the number of males, white and Negro, of voting age in these states. It
appears that from one-half to four-fifths of the males of voting age are
not voting, 83 per cent in South Carolina and 58 per cent in Alabama.
Because of the growing intelligence of Negroes in the South and the
progress which they are making along all lines, suggestions are being
made with respect to their admission to a greater extent to the exercise
of the franchise. Some of the prominent white newspapers of the South
have stated that it would be a good thing to increase the number of
Negro voters and “It would not endanger white supremacy and it could not
lead to Negro supremacy.” In spite of disabilities Negroes are taking
more and more interest both North and South in politics. The Negro
newspapers of the South are urging Negroes to qualify for voting. As
over against national politics the tendency appears to be to take more
and more interest in local politics. The reason for this is that Negroes
are appreciating to a larger extent those civic advantages which come
largely through politics; such as better educational facilities, better
police protection, better sanitary conditions, etc.</p>
<h3 id="a-growing-race-consciousness">A Growing Race Consciousness</h3>
<p>The racial struggle of the years has gradually resulted in the Negro
thinking largely in terms of his race, and as a result of this there has
evolved a racial consciousness. This race or group consciousness of the
Negro is growing. This growth is manifesting itself in various ways
important among which are an increasing interest in race literature,
more faith in race leadership, a demand for patronage of Negro
businesses, a tendency to boycott white firms which do not treat the
Negro with courtesy, and a tendency to move away from communities in
which lynchings have occurred.</p>
<p>Organization is an indication of the growth of racial consciousness.
This means not only organizations through the church, through secret
societies, but also organizations for the betterment of conditions, for
better educational facilities, for civic improvement, for economic
development, and for greater participation in politics. There are among
Negroes national organizations as follows: professional, (including
education, law, and medicine); business; labor, for political and civic
advancement; and organizations in the interest of women.</p>
<p>Another phase of the growth of race consciousness is that the Negro
is developing a literature of his own. Through his numerous newspapers,
periodicals, books, and articles he is becoming more and more able to
set forth his own needs, to state his own case, and to champion his own
cause.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">44</span></p>
<h3 id="race-relations">Race Relations</h3>
<p>Since the Negro and the white man live as two separate groups the
relations of these groups present a situation that has become a matter
of vital importance to both races. The main facts about race relations
are that prejudice and discriminations continue. There are lynchings and
occasional riots. There is an apparent growth and spread of both
tolerance and intolerance. This is a result of a wider and a more
continued contact which the Negro group is establishing with the white
group. The friendly relations of the two groups are being furthered by
the inter-racial cooperation movement which is bringing representatives
of the two groups into working relations with each other. The spirit of
inter-racial cooperation appears to be growing. There is more and more
of a disposition for the white people of the South to aid in efforts for
the betterment of conditions among Negroes. Another phase of race
relations is that the Negro group is tending to share to a larger degree
in the community life. Its importance as a part of the community is
being more and more recognized and community activities are being
extended to this group. This group is also being asked to participate in
the community activities, and as a result, the Negro group is tending to
take a more active part in community life.</p>
<h3 id="the-negro-is-an-asset-of-the-nation">The Negro Is an Asset of
the Nation</h3>
<p>The Negro is one of the most valuable assets of the nation’s
population elements. The conditions brought about hy the World War gave
the Negro opportunity to demonstrate in a striking way his importance as
an economic asset to the nation. The crisis which developed in the
nation by reason of the World War disclosed the fact that many elements
of the population were a weakness to the nation and in some instances a
hindrance and a danger. It was found that the Negro along with the
native American element was one of the strongest assets which the nation
had and that in every instance he remained loyal to the nation in spite
of German propaganda. When called upon to contribute of his wealth for
the prosecution of the war he made a proportionately larger contribution
than did any other group. Over $225,000,000 was contributed which is
more than $20 for each man, woman, and child of the race. The Negroes
offered themselves freely for service in the World War and furnished a
larger percentage for their group than did the whites for their
group—70.41 per cent of the whites and 74.60 per cent of the Negroes
were accepted for service, and 26.84 per cent of the whites and 31.74
per cent of the Negroes were accepted for full military service. As
combat troops, as pioneer and working battalions, and in whatever
service the Negro was placed he acquitted himself with credit and honor.
They were the first soldiers of the American expeditionary forces to get
into action and the first soldiers of the American army to be decorated
for bravery.</p>
<h2 id="ii.-analysis-and-interpretation">II. Analysis and
Interpretation</h2>
<p>In order to properly analyze and interpret the race problem in 1923
it is important to first consider the problem historically; that is,
what was the race problem in the United States in the Ante-Bellum Period
and in the Reconstruction Period. It is also well to point out what have
been the permanent factors and elements in the race problem during these
periods. These permanent factors and elements appear to be race
differences, race prejudice, racial friction or race conflict, and
efforts for racial adjustment. These factors and elements are found to
be present and to constitute the race problem anywhere at any time.</p>
<p>During the Ante-Bellum Period there was both a slavery question and a
race question and both were concerned with the same group of people. The
slavery question was in the main a question of status; that is, whether
those Negroes held as slaves should continue tof be slaves or be freed.
The race question in the main was one of relations and while including
status it was broader because it dealt with relations of black and white
whether bond or free. The main features of the race problem during the
Ante-Bellum Period were the questions of the relation of master to
slave, the right of the slave, the laws relating to the slave, the
rights of the free Negro and the laws relating to him and restrictions
imposed upon him. The Post-Bellum Period, that is, the Period of
Reconstruction, saw the Negro group change from a group part of which
was free and part slave with the free only a little above that of the
slave as to status and citizens’ rights to a group which under the
Constitution was accorded all the rights and privileges that had
hitherto been accorded only to the white group. This sudden change from
the status of slaves and free Negroes to freedmen with full citizenship
rights resulted in much confusion and conflict and also in violence
which found its expression in the riots of the Reconstruction Period and
in the reign of the Ku Klux Klan. Organized discriminations found their
expression at a somewhat later period in laws which restricted the
rights and privileges of the Negro with respect to schools, with respect
to public places, public conveyances, and with reference to the
franchise. These restrictions were to a very large degree modified
applications of the restrictions which in the Ante-Bellum Period had
been imposed upon the free Negro.</p>
<p>In the Ante-Bellum Period the problem of racial adjustment was
primarily that of accommodation; that is, of adjusting the slave group
to the interests and needs of the master group without any change in
status of the slave group and without any special effort to better the
social and moral conditions of the group. The basis of adjustment in the
Post-Bellum Period and since has been primarily that of assimilation;
that is, to take this group of freedmen and by giving them the
opportunity for economic, educational, moral, and religious development
to <span class="pagenum">45</span> make them a real part of the nation.
The two phases of adjustment, accommodation and assimilation, while in a
sense complementary to each other, have continued to the present time in
more or less opposition to each other. The accommodation phase of
adjustment has been largely expressed in the efforts to continue to keep
the Negro in the same relations to the white group as obtained during
the period of slavery. This has been crystallized in the expression,
“Keep the Negro in his place.” It is well to point out here that by
assimilation is not meant either miscegenation or amalgamation, although
the mulatto element in the Negro group is increasing not so much,
however, through miscegenation as through marriage within the group;
that is, the marriage of the mulatto with mulatto and the marriage of
the mulatto with the so-called black.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"

<h3 id="methods-of-dealing-with-the-race-problem">Methods of Dealing
with the Race Problem</h3>
<p>Until recently the race problem has been dealt with largely from a
coercive standpoint. By the coercive method we mean that adjustment is
sought by agitation and compulsion particularly by means of the
enactment of laws. In the handling of the race problem, as of other
social problems, agitation and coercive methods have their place and
their value.</p>
<p>During the Reconstruction Period and for some considerable time
after, the major portion of the discussion of the race problem was
largely in northern periodicals by means of articles written by northern
writers, by Negroes, and by southern writers. The present tendency in
the discussion of the race problem is that, in general, these
discussions and suggestions are more and more often being published in
the press of the region where the particular phases of the problem in
discussion exist. Whereas formerly the greater part of the discussion of
the race problem was in the magazines, by far the greater portion of the
present discussions are in the newspapers, white and colored. The
present tendency with reference to discussing the race problem in the
South by residents of that section appears to be that when an
individual, white or black, wishes to express himself on the race
problem he more often publishes his views in a southern paper than in a
northern paper, thus more affectively molding opinion in the section in
which he lives.</p>
<p>The next step resulting from this molding of opinion is the coming
together of whites and Negroes in conferences with reference to
outlining a basis of adjustment. We have as a result and as an outgrowth
of these conferences what is known as the Inter-racial Cooperation
Movement, which is primarily an effort of southern whites and Negroes to
get together on a basis of cooperation.</p>
<p>The inter-racial conference method of handling the race problem has
universal application. The general advantage is that representatives of
the interested groups may meet face to face and outline a policy that is
of mutual benefit to both groups. Another aspect of the universality of
this method is that it is very closely related to and embodies the idea
of working with and not for a group. Under assimilation (the
inter-racial method), things are done for the best interest of the two
groups and for the general good. But under the accommodation method
things are done by one group for the other.</p>
<p>There was inter-racial cooperation during both the Ante-Bellum and
Post-Bellum Periods. The Post-Bellum Period was especially notable for
interracial cooperation. This cooperation, however, was of a kind that
did not attract public attention for the reason that it was not
organized and was for the most part of individuals with individuals and
for religious, economic, and educational purposes. The present
inter-racial movement is organized and has specific stated ends for
which it is working. These ends are in a general way to secure social
justice, a square deal for the Negro, and to bring about the cooperation
of whites with Negroes for the best interest of the South and of the
nation.</p>
<h3 id="the-race-problem-no-longer-sectional-but-national">The Race
Problem No Longer Sectional But National</h3>
<p>The race problem in the United States is no longer sectional. It has
always been national in that it concerned the whole nation; but so long
as there were comparatively few Negroes in the North and the problem in
its acuteness was in the South, it was thought of as being sectional. It
was on this ground that the statement was often made that the South
should be permitted to handle the problem in its own way. The recent
migration of the Negro has made the problem in its acuteness a national
one. It should be considered, not as a problem of the Negro in the South
or the Negro in the North, but as a problem of the nation.</p>
<h3 id="world-contacts">World Contacts</h3>
<p>The Negro groups of the world by means of the World War came into
strikingly influencing contact with each other. This contact has been
strengthened and continued through the perfecting of world methods of
communication and the general diffusion of knowledge concerning what is
going on in every part of the world. The Negroes by means of the
literature which they have developed in America, in Africa, in the West
Indies, and through the general literature of the world have continued
this contact. The Negroes in America know what the Negroes in Africa and
in the West Indies are thinking. The Pan-African Movement and the
so-called Garvey Movement are the direct results of this contact through
communication which the Negroes in different parts of the world have
established. It is probable that it will be very difficult for the
prob<span class="pagenum">46</span>lem of the Negro in America, the
problem of the Negro in the West Indies, and the problem of the Negro in
Africa to be handled as one universal problem to the Negro. These
groups, however, may be able to give moral and other support to each
other.</p>
<h3 id="progress-and-the-race-problem">Progress and the Race
Problem</h3>
<p>It is sometimes stated that the progress of the Negro will be a
solution of the race problem. The facts, however, indicate that
progress, instead of being a solution of the problem, may sometimes
intensify, complicate, and make it more difficult. The Negro by reason
of his making progress along all lines is coming into contact with the
white group in many and varied ways. This contact has two tendencies;
one favorable, one unfavorable. One tends to increase friction, the
other to promote more friendly relations. An important part of the
adjusting of the race problem is to reduce friction and to bring about
more friendly relations, more interracial cooperation.</p>
<h3 id="progress-is-making-the-negro-a-more-assimilable-group">Progress
is Making the Negro a More Assimilable Group</h3>
<p>During the days of slavery through the house servant and mechanic,
the free Negro class and in other ways the Negro group was in contact
with the best culture of the South. Since emancipation through northern
education the Negro, as a group, has been in touch with the best culture
and traditions of the North. The Negroes of America, as a group, have no
traditions binding them to another country or another culture. They have
no heritages in the sense that the foreign elements of the country have.
No part of the Negro group is advocating that the group should not
acquire the culture of the nation; on the other hand, the whole effort
of the group is to foster the ideals of America and to make progress not
only as Negroes but as Americans.</p>
