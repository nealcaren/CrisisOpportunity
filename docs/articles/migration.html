<p><span class="pagenum">7</span>The Negro population in northern United
States increased in the ten years between 1910 and 1920 from 1,000,000
to more than 1,500,000. Since the larger part of this half million
increase occurred in the few years prior to 1920 and the increase since
1920 has been at about the same rate, it is fair to estimate that there
are now close to two million Negroes north of the Mason and Dixon line.
The increase was due in the main to the migration of Negroes from the
South and to the relatively small West Indian immigration.</p>
<p>The increase in the Negro population of New York State from 1910 to
1920 was 64,292. In 1910, the Negro population was 134,191; in 1920,
198,483. Estimated on the basis of an annual increment of 9,363, the
1925 Negro population of this State can conservatively be estimated at
245,296. This is on the assumption that the annual increase from 1910 to
1915 was the same as between 1900 and 1910, and the 1915 to 1920 annual
increment continued through to 1925. Of the State’s Negro population of
198,483 in 1920, 31,425 were born in Virginia; 26,428 in the Carolinas
(about an equal number from North and from South Carolina); Georgia
furnished 8,650; Maryland, 4,272; Florida, 3,657, and the Northern
States of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, 3,537 and 3,611 each. There were
25,454 from the West Indies outside of the United States’ possessions
and 1,431 from the Virgin Islands. It is estimated that there was a net
increase of about 24,000 foreign born Negroes in the United States
between 1920 and 1923. New York City’s Negro population in 1920 was
152,467, leaving a total of 46,016 in other sections of the State. The
Negro population in New York City at present is in excess of
200,000.</p>
<p>Before discussing in detail the situation in regard to the factors
which led to the Negro migration to this State and the social complexion
of the Negro population here, it might be well to discuss a little the
general Negro question from the standpoint of the Negro in the North,
which will have a direct bearing on the situation in this State.</p>
<p>Although the migration from the South has been largely from rural and
small town districts, the population in the North is almost entirely
centered in urban communities, where death and birth rates are about
equal, thereby providing practically no natural increase. The majority
of the million Negro new-comers mentioned above came to the North
preceding and following the participation of the United States in the
World War. The causes of this migration are well known—the industrial
labor vacuum caused in the North by the departure of foreign reservists
for service in Europe, drafting of many men from the North’s industrial
centers, the speeding up of industry incident to the war, and the push
from the South caused by the withholding of personal, civic and
educational rights from the Negro, and especially the persistent
persecution of Negroes by the lawless white element, against which no
protection was afforded. Though it is true that in the South the Negro
has not been denied industrial opportunity as a skilled or unskilled
worker, his wages there have been relatively low and his treatment at
the hands of white men in authority, both on the job and in connection
with his civic and home affairs, has made him feel constantly restricted
and oppressed.</p>
<p>A discussion ten years ago on the Negro in thi North would have
consisted primarily of a consideration of the housing conditions and the
general wage scale of Negroes employed here and there in responsible
positions where their work was in the main associated with white people.
But a discussion of this subject today would embrace a study of these
masses of Negroes who have recently come to the North, the successes or
failures with which they have met in seeking social adjustment, the
development of larger industrial opportunities individually and as a
group and the material progress made thus far in business and
professional life. Negro cities, as it were, within the already
established cities, may be seen in New York, in Pittsburgh, Boston, in
Chicago, in Cleveland, in Detroit, in Philadelphia and in many other
Northern and border communities. Here Negro banks, theatres, hotels,
restaurants, stores of all kinds, real estate offices and modern
churches with social service facilities are in evidence, and Negro
doctors, lawyers, architects, social workers and other professional men
and women are kept constantly busy ministering to the needs of their own
people.</p>
<p>Of course, Negroes have been migrating to the North in large numbers
during the period between the Civil War and the World War. But this
migration has only been in answer to the demand, in the main, for
personal servants, and such social problems among Negroes as arose in
Northern cities were of such gradual growth that, though existent, they
did not alter to any great extent the condition of the communities. When
the war period set in, however, communities to which Negroes went began
to realize that they had a new problem of their own.</p>
<p>The economic urge has probably been the strongest force at work in
inducing Negroes to seek new abodes. Records show that even from many
counties in Georgia, Alabama and Texas where lynchings have been most
numerous, Negroes have left in smaller proportionate numbers than from
those counties where no lynchings have occurred, provided the economic
conditions were not unfavorable in the former sections. In fact, in
several counties where lynchings have been frequent, the whites have
left in larger proportionate numbers than have the Negroes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">8</span>Therefore, in moving North, the Negroes
have sought those communities giving them the most promising industrial
and economic outlook. These communities in an overwhelming majority of
cases have been those where basic industries thrived. Thus Pittsburgh
and Detroit, Cleveland and Chicago, and the satellite towns of Gary,
Duquesne, Homestead and Steelton have received large Negro accretions.
Between 1910 and 1920 Negro population of Akron increased 749.3%;
Detroit, 611.3%; Chicago, 148.2%; Cleveland, 307.8%; Toledo, 203.2%.</p>
<p>New York State has but few cities of the type sought by Negroes in
the recent migration. Thus with the exception of New York City and
Buffalo few cities in the State have received very great additional
Negro citizens. Buffalo’s Negro population increased 154.4 per cent
between 1910 and 1920 and New York City’s 66.3 per cent.</p>
<p>Withal, life among the Negroes in New York City is approaching a
normal state. The cosmopolitanism of the city attracts the Negro. The
heterogeneity of the population has generated an atmosphere of freedom
and democracy. The city’s reputation has been broadcasted to every nook
and corner of the Southland, and when Negroes decide to move it is
natural for those along the Atlantic Seaboard to think of New York and
act accordingly.</p>
<p>The present British West Indian immigration of the Negro is now very
small due to the recent interpretation of the British quota
understanding which links the British West Indian citizen with those of
the British Isles in determining the number of West Indians who are
eligible to enter our port. The custom has been for those who have come
in the past to remain in New York with but few going on to other
cities.</p>
<p>Buffalo’s increase in Negro population from 1,773 to 4,511 between
1910 and 1920 and to 9,058 by 1923 was due principally to the activities
of the Lackawanna Steel Company, which at one time had as many as 1,000
Negro employees. It brought 6,000 Negroes into Buffalo, but its wages
were so much lower than those maintained by other industries in that
community that it was able to retain less than one thousand of this
number, the excess being employed by six other industries which used
Negroes in considerable numbers. The brick-yards along the west shore of
the Hudson River, centering at Haverstraw, employ Negroes in
considerable numbers during the brick-making season and there are
several industries in Syracuse and Rochester that use them in some
numbers.</p>
<p>The largest majority of the Negro migrants have settled in New York
City and the adjacent counties of Westchester and Nassau. One has to
seek a variety of occupations to locate the attraction, and it is found
that Negroes are employed in numbers in New York in 316 of the 321
occupations listed in the Federal Census for New York City. In each of
175 of these occupations over 50 Negroes are employed. It is interesting
to note the preponderance of women over men in the Negro population of
New York City, the ratio being 92.6 Negro men to 100 Negro women. This
is because of the fact that there have been more jobs available for
women than for men—domestic service claiming, as in years past, the
largest number of Negro women employees.</p>
<p>In recent years some significant changes have taken place. Last year
there were over 3,000 women workers in the garment trades. They are also
employed as milliners and as novelty makers. Although there has been an
increase in the actual number of colored women employed as domestic
servants, the proportion of colored women to the total number of
domestic servants has decreased. This is a reflection of the increase in
men’s wages and improvement in the types of jobs available to Negro men.
There has been an actual reduction in the number of married colored
women at work. There are over 6,000 Negro longshoremen in New York City.
Men are also employed as chauffeurs, porters in mercantile
establishments and in railroad terminals and on the subway and elevated
lines. There is a great increase in the number of Civil Service
employees—Municipal, State and Federal. Negroes are entering business
and engaging more largely in the professions. Their physicians, lawyers,
clergymen, school teachers, real estate operators and social workers are
increasing rapidly as capable persons are acquiring the necessary
training.</p>
<p>Mrs. G. E. McDougald, in a study of advancement of former Negro
public school pupils cites several interesting typical cases of
individual achievement of Negroes. The first and the last positions of
the individuals are listed:</p>

<p>Towards the close of the unemployment period of 1914, when the
Seventh Avenue Subway was being <span
class="pagenum">9</span>constructed in New York, the National Urban
League placed several hundred Negro laborers with subway contractors. In
the present new subway construction there are several young Negro
engineers employed in this service. As evidence of a growing opportunity
for trained young colored men and women in this State, I refer to a few
unusual positions held by Negroes: Draughtsmen in the building
department of the Board of Education and in the Department of Docks and
Bridges; special writer on a large daily newspaper; special writer for
women’s page of a large monthly periodical; salesman for a very large
real estate firm; sub-contractor for building the forms for the concrete
being poured for the foundations of the nev Columbia-Presbyterian
Hospital; civil engineer employed on this job, which is keeping about
125 carpenters and laborers busy; 500 public school teachers; a
vice-principal; a principal retired this year; lecturers for the Board
of Education; Department of Health nurses; a certified public
accountant; instructors in a dental college and in an opthalmic college.
I mention a few of the important positions as they are filled almost
entirely by Negroes who have migrated to New York State. And,
incidentally, here we might state that three-fourths of the businesses
conducted by Negroes in New York City are owned by Southern Negroes and
a large part of the remainder by West Indians.</p>
<p>New York City has become the center of intellectual and cultural life
among Negroes of America as a result of the migration. The headquarters
of the leading Negro organizations working for Negro welfare, whether
social or civil, are located in this city, and the most successful,
influential and intellectual leaders of the race have been engaged by
these organizations to conduct their national activities and propaganda
from New York as a center. Thus this community has become the dynamo for
generating the social energies propelling the Negro masses towards what
they hope will be a better day. There are Dr. W. E. B. DuBois, the
race’s most fluent and influential writer, a native of Massachusetts,
coming to New York from Georgia, where he had been for fourteen years,
who is the Editor of the <em>Crisis</em>, the organ of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and James Weldon
Johnson, poet, author, secretary of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, a native of Florida and one of the race’s
most trusted and serviceable leaders; and William Pickens, one of
America’s great orators, uncompromising champion of Negro rights, a
native of Arkansas; Harry Burleigh, musician, composer, baritone in
St. George’s Choir, known for his musical works, not as a Negro
musician, a native of Erie, Penna.; and Paul Robeson, actor, born in New
Jersey; and Charles Gilpin, of “Emperor Jones” fame, native of Richmond,
Va.; and Charles S. Johnson, brilliant editor of <em>Opportunity—A
Journal of Negro Life</em>, native of Bristol, Va.; and Walter F. White,
author and publicist, formerly of Atlanta; and Jessie Fauset, author and
assistant to the <em>Crisis</em> editor, native of Philadelphia;
Channing H. Tobias, Director of Colored Y.M.C.A. work, native of
Augusta, Ga.; Miss Eva Bowles, holding a similar position with the
Y.W.C.A., a native of Columbus, Ohio, and many other such individuals
who have adopted New York as their home.</p>
<p>It seems to be a general impression among Negroes throughout the
country that in this State they have a better chance for advancement,
more rights as citizens and better prospects for the future than in
other States of the Union. When the saturation point is reached for the
moment in the increase of Negro population in New York and there is a
dearth of jobs available to those who have migrated to the city, the
backwash or surplus Negro population goes into such New Jersey
communities as Plainfield, Newark, the Oranges, Jersey City, Montclair,
Paterson, and into Westchester County towns such as New Rochelle, Mt.
Vernon, White Plains and Yonkers and such Long Island centers as
Mineola, Rockville Center, Glen Cove, Hempstead and Freeport.</p>
<p>Of course, with the large increase in the Negro population in this
State, especially New York City, there must be attendant problems of
housing and health and a decided increase in delinquency, juvenile and
adult.</p>
<p>Due to the strategic move on the part of certain colored real estate
men some fifteen years ago, the Negroes in New York City are occupying
one of the most healthful districts of our large city—that is Harlem,
where, north of 125th Street, 100,000 Negroes are now residing.
Unfortunately, the houses built before their arrival were not designed
to meet the needs and cope with the economic handicaps of the Negroes.
Most of the inhabitants have been forced to occupy apartments with
rentals beyond their income, and the lodger evil has complicated the
social life of the group. In recent years an effort has been made to
build houses with two, three and four-room apartments; but with the high
cost of building material and labor, the average rental per room has
been from $20 to $25 and the problem is still present in a little
different form. Corona, Jamaica, Flushing, East New York and several
other suburban sections in and around New York have furnished some
relief by affording small five and six-room homes to thrifty home buyers
of average income.</p>
<p>Although there has been very little natural increase in the Negro
population, the movement of Negroes into zones of better living and
working conditions is resulting in better health conditions. The death
rate among Negroes is gradually on the decrease. In fact, the death rate
in Northern cities is lower among Negroes today than in Southern cities;
despite the advanced age group comprising our Northern Negro population
and the alleged difficulties that Negroes are supposed to experience in
adjusting themselves to the more rigorous winters of the North. The
Negro death rate in New York City was 37.5 per 1,000 in 1890; in 1910 it
was 25, and in 1921 was 17.9. The Negro infant mortality in New York
City is decidedly on <span class="pagenum">10</span>the decline,
following inversely the trend of family income of Negroes.</p>
<p>In 1915, when an investigation was made of infant mortality among the
Negroes in New York City, it was discovered that in one section of the
city where the largest percentage of mothers worked and where the
families had the smallest incomes and the largest percentage of lodgers,
and therefore more overcrowding, Negro infant mortality was 314 per
1,000, while for the entire city for the colored people it was 202 per
1,000 and for the whites 96 per 1,000. A campaign of improvement was
organized in which social welfare agencies, the Health Department,
employment placement bureaus, public schools, and, in fact, all agencies
that touch the life of the family were brought into active cooperation
to handle effectively this unfortunate situation. The Negro infant
mortality for the city was reduced in two years from 202 per 1,000 to
173 per 1,000—a reduction of 29 points. In 1919, the infant mortality
among Negroes in that district in New York City where in 1915 the rate
was 314 per 1,000 had been reduced to a point lower than the infant
mortality of the whites in the same district.</p>
<p>While there is not sufficient data for a scientific prophecy of the
industrial future of the Negro group in New York State, we have
sufficient information to form an opinion hopeful or otherwise. In a
recent survey in Buffalo of 45 industrial plants employing 2,922 Negro
workers, 32 were satisfied with their labor and 13 were not. Of the 13,
estimates ranged from tolerance to such qualified expressions of
satisfaction as “fair” or “greater part are satisfactory,” and “in some
respects ‘yes’ and the most part ‘no.’” One interesting reply should be
noted. A plant that had never employed more than one colored worker
stated that because this man was found dishonest, the plant had
established a policy of employing no more Negroes. One plant reported
that it found them “90% efficient.” This indicates a willingness to
employ Negroes indefinitely. Furthermore, the variety of work engaged in
by Negroes in New York City precluded a likelihood of any wholesale
dismissing of Negro workers. Also there are already evidences of a
demand for both skilled and unskilled workers in excess of a possible
available supply from white immigration and normal increase of native
white workers through the existing agencies of developing new workers.
Although the growth of the union labor movements threatened Negro
artisans, 1920 saw an increase in Negro carpenters from 268 to 737,
chauffeurs from 490 to 2,195, workers on clothing from none to 6,000 and
workers in textiles from a very few to 2,685; shoemakers from 14 to 581;
stationary firemen from 249 to 1,076, and mechanics from very few or
none to 467. Incidentally Negro real estate agents increased from 89 to
247. Evidently the Negro migrant is here to stay a while. It is somewhat
of a paradox, however, that in those lines where the unions,
workingmen’s friends, are strongest, the Negro has made the scantiest
progress.</p>
<p>Ten years added but eighteen Negro brick-masons, eighty-one painters,
sixteen plasterers and forty-two plumbers. But even in this direction
the future is not without its encouraging prospects. In New York City an
organization composed of white and colored representatives of Trade
Unions has recently been formed to help increase the number of Negro
members of the Trade Unions.</p>
<p>The most discouraging phase of the Negro migration situation is that
of delinquency. A much larger proportion of Negroes are arrested and
convicted of crimes and misdemeanors than they comprise of the total
population. This is unquestionably due in large measure to the absence
of preventive social forces in the lives of adolescent Negro youth. The
much smaller juvenile delinquency rate, however, indicates that there is
no racial bent toward crime and that with the further development of the
agencies of social control, there will be a turn for the better. During
the migration period juvenile delinquency among Negro children in New
York increased from a point less than the Negro’s proportion of the
population to a point slightly in excess of their proportion of the
population. In 1922 out of 817 cases in the Children’s Court of Buffalo
only four were colored—two boys and two girls—while the figures for
Buffalo showed up well for the colored children, they probably indicate
laxity in handling the child problem among the colored people in
Buffalo, on the part of the municipal authorities. I should say before
leaving this point that the Children’s Aid Society in Buffalo has done
some very fine work with colored cases coming under its supervision.</p>
<p>Negro church organizations and social service movements are
developing more efficiency and better organized programs of service. The
personnel employed by these organizations is increasingly of a higher
intellectual standard and as a result of their work the standard of
living among Negro families seems to be improving. The schools are
recording great increases in pupils in the elementary and high school
grades also for collegiate and professional studies. The Negro church
has developed more rapidly, of course, than any other one institution
among the Negro migrants of the State. Practically every group of a
hundred or more Negroes in scores of towns throughout the State has its
church organizations. In Buffalo fifteen Negro churches are in
existence, five having edifices. The total value of the church property
there is $294,200 and the membership of eleven churches was 2,789 in
1923. In Greater New York the seating capacity of Negro churches was
24,000 in 1920. In 1924 it was 21,000 in Harlem alone. The most costly
Negro church edifice in Harlem—the Mt. Olivet Baptist—was purchased for
$450,000. The Abyssinian Baptist Church, containing institutional
features, was erected at a cost of $325,000, with only $25,000 remaining
on mortgage. The St. Philip’s Protestant Episcopal Church has over a
million dollars of church and apartment house property. The St. Mark’s
Methodist Episcopal Church is erecting a new institu<span
class="pagenum">11</span>tional church there at a cost of nearly half a
million dollars. There are four Harlem churches with parish houses, four
others with institutional features and several contemplating extra
social service activities. In Westchester County alone there are
thirty-eight established colored churches with between 7,000 and 7,500
seating capacity available to a total Negro population of 11,066.
Thirty-two of these churches own or are buying property.</p>
<p>In Nassau and Suffolk Counties there are thirty-three colored
churches, twenty-five of which are owned by the colored people and cater
to a colored population in twenty towns and villages of between 8,000
and 10,000 persons, 42 per cent of whom migrated to these counties
between 1910 and 1920.</p>
<p>All of these factors are tending to produce a group of citizens
conscious of their civic and social responsibilities.</p>
<p>The increase in the Negro population in the State due to the
migration is adding to the political strength of the group in the State.
Several years ago there were a Negro assemblyman and two Negro aldermen
at one time representing the Harlem Negroes in legislative bodies.
During the last presidential campaign a Negro made a creditable run for
Congress from this same district. This increased voting strength is
sensibly divided between the various parties and is reflected in
increased representation in the appointive positions accorded the race
in the city and State. Some more important positions of recent years
have been State Commissioner of Agriculture, Municipal Civil Service
Commissioner, Collector of Internal Revenue (Federal), Deputy Federal
District Attorney, Assistant District Attorney for New York County.</p>
<p>Not only the Negro political representatives of the Negro population,
but the white politicians also who have increasing Negro constituencies
are in the main making honest efforts to help in the upbuilding of the
Negro’s civic life.</p>
<p>If there is any concern at all in connection with Negro migration to
this State, rather should it be on the attitude assumed by the white
citizens of our various communities towards the newcomers. We are
engaged in America in an experiment of national life which at present is
an example to the rest of the world. We have made great strides forward
in handling most all of the social problems we face. Probably we have
made less progress in solving the problem of race contacts than in any
other direction. Most people assume an air of indifference towards this
question. Others are prejudiced—bitter and unreasonable. But we cannot
forever ignore the problem. New York State has probably shown a fairer
attitude and more open mind in handling these questions than has any
other State of our country and New York City may prove to be the
laboratory in which the most satisfactory local experiment will be
conducted. Certainly there is no single spot of its size on the globe
where so many white people and Negroes reside and where ambition and
competition are so strong, and yet where there are so few points of
friction.</p>
<p>The opportunity for statesmanship service to humanity is ours. The
obligation is ours. We cannot pass on to posterity the responsibility
for work which we should assume. The challenge of democracy is before
us. The Negro is probably the real test of democracy in America. Shall
this democracy endure? The Negro migrant to New York State may yet give
the answer.</p>
