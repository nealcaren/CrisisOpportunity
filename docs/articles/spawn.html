<p>A modified form of slavery survives wherever prison labor is sold to
private persons for their pecuniary profit.–<em>Wines.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two systems of controlling human labor which still flourish in the
South are the direct children of slavery, and to all intents and
purposes are slavery itself. These are the crop-lien system and the
convict-lease system. The crop-lien system is an arrangement of chattel
mortgages so fixed that the housing, labor, kind of agricul<span
class="pagenum">738</span>ture and, to some extent, the personal liberty
of the free black laborer is put into the hands of the landowner and
merchant. It is absentee landlordism and the “company-store” systems
united and carried out to the furthest possible degree. The
convict-lease system is the slavery in private hands of persons
convicted of crimes and misdemeanors in the courts. The object of the
present paper is to study the rise and development of the convict-lease
system, and the efforts to modify and abolish it.</p>
<p>Before the Civil War the system of punishment for criminals was
practically the same as in the North. Except in a few cities, however,
crime was less prevalent than in the North, and the system of slavery
naturally modified the situation. The slaves could become criminals in
the eyes of the law only in exceptional cases. The punishment and trial
of nearly all ordinary misdemeanors and crimes lay in the hands of the
masters. Consequently, so far as the state was concerned, there was no
crime of any consequence among Negroes. The system of criminal
jurisprudence had to do, therefore, with whites almost exclusively, and
as is usual in a land of scattered population and aristocratic
tendencies, the law was lenient in theory and lax in execution.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the private well-ordering and control of slaves
called for careful cooperation among masters. The fear of insurrection
was ever before the South, and the ominous uprising of Cato, Gabriel,
Vesey, Turner, and Toussaint made this fear an ever-present nightmare.
The result was a system of rural police, mounted and on duty chiefly at
night, whose work it was to stop the nocturnal wandering and meeting of
slaves. It was usually an effective organization, which terrorized the
slaves, and to which all white men belonged, and were liable to active
detailed duty at regular intervals.</p>
<p>Upon this system war and emancipation struck like a thunderbolt. Law
and order among the whites, already loosely enforced, became still
weaker through the inevitable influence of conflict and social
revolution. The freedman was especially in an anomalous situation. The
power of the slave police supplemented and depended upon that of the
private masters. When the masters’ power was broken the patrol was
easily transmuted into a lawless and illegal mob known to history as the
Ku Klux Klan. Then came the first, and probably the most disastrous, of
that succession of political expedients by which the South sought to
evade the consequences of emancipation. It will always be a nice
question of ethics as to how far a conquered people can be expected to
submit to the dictates of a victorious foe. Certainly the world must to
a degree sympathize with resistance under such circumstances. The
mistake of the South, however, was to adopt a kind of resistance which
in the long run weakened her moral fiber, destroyed respect for law and
order, and enabled gradually her worst elements to secure an unfortunate
ascendency. The South believed <span class="pagenum">739</span>in slave
labor, and was thoroughly convinced that free Negroes would not work
steadily or effectively. The whites were determined after the war,
therefore, to restore slavery in everything but in name. Elaborate and
ingenious apprentice and vagrancy laws were passed, designed to make the
freedmen and their children work for their former masters at practically
no wages. Some justification for these laws was found in the inevitable
tendency of many of the ex-slaves to loaf when the fear of the lash was
taken away. The new laws, however, went far beyond such justification,
totally ignoring that large class of freedmen eager to work and earn
property of their own, stopping all competition between employers, and
confiscating the labor and liberty of children. In fact, the new laws of
this period recognized the Emancipation Proclamation and the Thirteenth
Amendment simply as abolishing the slave-trade.</p>

</figure>
<p>The interference of Congress in the plans for reconstruction stopped
the full carrying out of these schemes, and the Freedmen’s Bureau
consolidated and sought to develop the various plans for employing and
guiding the freedmen already adopted in different <span
class="pagenum">740</span>places under the protection of the Union army.
This government guardianship established a free wage system of labor by
the help of the army, the striving of the best of the blacks, and the
cooperation of some of the whites. In the matter of adjusting legal
relationships, however, the Bureau failed. It had, to be sure, Bureau
courts, with one representative of the ex-master, one of the freedman,
and one of the Bureau itself, but they never gained the confidence of
the community. As the regular state courts gradually regained power, it
was necessary for them to fix by their decisions the new status of the
freedmen. It was perhaps as natural as it was unfortunate that amid this
chaos the courts sought to do by judicial decisions what the
legislatures had formerly sought to do by specific law – namely, reduce
the freedmen to serfdom. As a result, the small peccadillos of a
careless, untrained class were made the excuse for severe sentences. The
courts and jails became filled with the careless and ignorant, with
those who sought to emphasize their new-found freedom, and too often
with innocent victims of oppression. The testimony of a Negro counted
for little or nothing in court, while the accusation of white witnesses
was usually decisive. The result of this was a sudden large increase in
the apparent criminal population of the Southern states – an increase so
large that there was no way for the state to house it or watch it even
had the state wished to. And the state did not wish to. Throughout the
South laws were immediately passed authorizing public officials to lease
the labor of convicts to the highest bidder. The lessee then took charge
of the convicts – worked them as he wished under the nominal control of
the state. Thus a new slavery and slave-trade was established.</p>
<h2 id="the-evil-influences">The Evil Influences</h2>
<p>The abuses of this system have often been dwelt upon. It had the
worst aspects of slavery without any of its redeeming features. The
innocent, the guilty, and the depraved were herded together, children
and adults, men and women, given into the complete control of
practically irresponsible men, whose sole object was to make the most
money possible. The innocent were made bad, the bad worse; women were
outraged and children tainted; whipping and torture were in vogue, and
the death-rate from cruelty, exposure, and overwork rose to large
percentages. The actual bosses over such leased prisoners were usually
selected from the lowest classes of whites, and the camps were often far
from settlements or public roads. The prisoners often had scarcely any
clothing, they were fed on a scanty diet of corn bread and fat meat, and
worked twelve or more hours a day. After work each must do his own
cooking. There was insufficient shelter; in one Georgia camp, as late as
1895, sixty-one men slept in one room, seventeen by nineteen feet, and
seven feet high. Sanitary conditions <span
class="pagenum">741</span>were wretched, there was little or no medical
attendance, and almost no care of the sick. Women were mingled
indiscriminately with the men, both in working and sleeping, and dressed
often in men’s clothes. A young girl at Camp Hardmont, Georgia, in 1895,
was repeatedly outraged by several of her guards, and finally died in
childbirth while in camp.</p>
<p>Such facts illustrate the system at its worst – as it used to exist
in nearly every Southern state, and as it still exists in parts of
Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, and other states. It is difficult to
say whether the effect of such a system is worse on the whites or on the
Negroes. So far as the whites are concerned, the convict-lease system
lowered the respect for courts, increased lawlessness, and put the
states into the clutches of penitentiary “rings.” The courts were
brought into politics, judgeships became elective for shorter and
shorter terms, and there grew up a public sentiment which would not
consent to considering the desert of a criminal apart from his color. If
the criminal were white, public opinion refused to permit him to enter
the chain-gang save in the most extreme cases. The result is that even
to-day it is very difficult to enforce the laws in the South against
whites, and red-handed criminals go scot-free. On the other hand, so
customary had to become to convict any Negro upon a mere accusation,
that public opinion was loathe to allow a fair trial to black suspects,
and was too often tempted to take the law into their own hands. Finally
the state became a dealer in crime, profited by it so as to derive a new
annual income for her prisoners. The lessees of the convicts made large
profits also. Under such circumstances, it was almost impossible to
remove the clutches of this vicious system from the state. Even as late
as 1890 the Southern states were the only section of the Union where the
income from prisons and reformatories exceeded the expense.<a

<p>The effect of the convict-lease system on the Negroes was deplorable.
First it linked crime and slavery indissolubly in their minds <span
class="pagenum">742</span>as simply forms of the white man’s oppression.
Punishment, consequently, lost the most effective of its deterrent
effects, and the criminal gained pity instead of disdain. The Negroes
lost faith in the integrity of courts and the fairness of juries. Worse
than all, the chain-gangs became schools of crime which hastened the
appearance of the confirmed Negro criminal upon the scene. That some
crime and vagrancy should follow emancipation was inevitable. A nation
can not systematically degrade labor without in some degree debauching
the laborer. But there can be no doubt but that the indiscriminate
careless and unjust method by which Southern courts dealt with the
freedmen after the war increased crime and vagabondage to an enormous
extent. There are no reliable statistics to which one can safely appeal
to measure exactly the growth of crime among the emancipated slaves.
About seventy per cent of all prisoners in the South are black; this,
however, is in part explained by the fact that accused Negroes are still
easily convicted and get long sentences, while whites still continue to
escape the penalty of many crimes even among themselves. And yet
allowing for all this, there can be no reasonable doubt but that there
has arisen in the South since the war a class of black criminals,
loafers, and ne’er-do-wells who are a menace to their fellows, both
black and white.</p>
<p>The appearance of the real Negro criminal stirred the South deeply.
The whites, despite their long use of the criminal court for putting
Negroes to work, were used to little more than petty thieving and
loafing on their part, and not to crimes of boldness, violence, or
cunning. When, after periods of stress or financial depression, as in
1892, such crimes increased in frequency, the wrath of a people
unschooled in the modern methods of dealing with crime broke all bounds
and reached strange depths of barbaric vengeance and torture. Such acts,
instead of drawing the best opinion of these states and of the nation
toward a consideration of Negro crime and criminals, discouraged and
alienated the best classes of Negroes, horrified the civilized world,
and made the best white Southerners ashamed of their land.</p>
<h2 id="what-has-been-done">What Has Been Done</h2>
<p>Nevertheless, in the midst of all this a leaven of better things had
been working and the bad effects of the epidemic of lynching quickened
it. The great difficulty to be overcome in the South was the false
theory of work and of punishment of wrong-doers inherited from slavery.
The inevitable result of a slave system is for a master class to
consider that the slave exists for his benefit alone – that the slave
has no rights which the master is bound to respect. Inevitably this idea
persisted after emancipation. The black workman existed for the comfort
and profit of white people, and the interests of white people were the
only ones to be seriously considered. Consequently, <span
class="pagenum">743</span>for a lessee to work convicts for his profit
was a most natural thing. Then, too, these convicts were to be punished,
and the slave theory of punishment was pain and intimidation. Given
these ideas, and the convict-lease system was inevitable. But other
ideas were also prevalent in the South; there were in slave times
plantations where the well-being of the slaves was considered, and where
punishment meant the correction of the fault rather than brute
discomfort. After the chaos of war and reconstruction passed, there came
from the better conscience of the South a growing demand for reform in
the treatment of crime. The worst horrors of the convict-lease system
were attacked persistently in nearly every Southern state. Back in the
eighties George W. Cable, a Southern man, published a strong attack on
the system. The following decade Governor Atkinson, of Georgia,
instituted a searching investigation, which startled the state by its
revelation of existing conditions. Still more recently Florida,
Arkansas, and other states have had reports and agitation for reform.
The result has been marked improvement in conditions during the last
decade. This is shown in part by the statistics of 1895; in that year
the prisons and reformatories of the far South costs the states $204,483
more than they earned, while before this they had nearly always yielded
an income. This is still the smallest expenditure of any section, and
looks strangely small beside New England’s $l,190,564. At the same time,
a movement in the right direction is clear. The laws are being framed
more and more so as to prevent the placing of convicts altogether in
private control. They are not, to be sure, always <span
class="pagenum">744</span>enforced, Georgia having several hundreds of
convicts so controlled in 1895 despite the law. In nearly all the Gulf
states the convict-lease system still has a strong hold, still debauches
public sentiment and breeds criminals.</p>

<p>The next step after the lease system was to keep the prisoners under
state control, or, at least, regular state inspection, but to lease
their labor to contractors, or to employ it in some remunerative labor
for the state. It is this stage that the South is slowly reaching to-day
so far as the criminals are concerned who are dealt with directly by the
states. Those whom the state still unfortunately leaves in the hands of
county officials are usually leased to irresponsible parties. Without
doubt, work, and work worth the doing – <em>i.e.,</em> profitable work –
is best for prisoners. Yet there lurks in this system a dangerous
temptation. The correct theory is that the work is for the benefit of
the criminal – for his correction, if possible. At the same time, his
work should not be allowed to come into unfair competition with that of
honest laborers, and it should never be an object of traffic for pure
financial gain. Whenever the profit derived from the work becomes the
object of employing prisoners, then evil must result. In the South
to-day it is natural that in the slow turning from the totally
indefensible private lease system, some of its wrong ideas should
persist. Prominent among these persisting ideas is this: that the most
successful dealing with criminals is that which costs the state least in
actual outlay. This idea still dominates most of the Southern states.
Georgia spent $2.38 per capita on her 2,938 prisoners in 1890, while
Massachusetts spent $62.96 per capita on her 5,227 prisoners. Moreover,
by selling the labor of her prisoners to the highest bidders, Georgia
not only got all her money back, but made a total clear profit of $6.12
on each prisoner, Massachusetts spent about $100,000 more than was
returned to her by prisoners’ labor. Now it is extremely difficult,
under such circumstances, to prove to a state that Georgia is making a
worse business investment than Massachusetts. It will take another
generation to prove to the South that an apparently profitable traffic
in crime is very dangerous business for a state; that prevention of
crime and the reformation of criminals is the one legitimate object of
all dealing with depraved natures, and that apparent profit arising from
other methods is in the end worse than dead loss. Bad public schools and
profit from crime explain much of the Southern social problem. Georgia,
Florida, and Louisiana, as late as 1895, were spending annually only
$20,799 on their state prisoners, and receiving $80,493 from the hire of
their labor.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the desire to make the labor of criminals pay, little
heed is taken of the competition of convict and free laborers, unless
the free laborers are white and have a vote. Black laborers are
continually displaced in such industries as brick-making, mining,
road-<span class="pagenum">745</span>building, grading, quarrying, and
the like, by convicts hired at $3, or thereabouts, a month.</p>
<p>The second mischievous idea that survives from slavery and the
convict-lease system is the lack of all intelligent discrimination in
dealing with prisoners. The most conspicuous and fatal example of this
is the indiscriminate herding of juvenile and adult criminals. It need
hardly be said that such methods manufacture criminals more quickly than
all other methods can reform them. In 1890, of all the Southern states,
only Texas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Maryland, and West Virginia made any
state appropriations for juvenile reformatories. In 1895 Delaware was
added to these, but Kentucky was missing. We have, therefore:</p>

<p>And this in face of the fact that the South had in 1980 over four
thousand prisoners under twenty years of age. In some of the Southern
states – notably, Virginia – there are private associations for juvenile
reform, acting in cooperation with the state. These have, in some cases,
recently received state aid, I believe. In other states, like Georgia,
there is permissive legislation for the establishment of local
reformatories. Little has resulted as yet from this legislation, but it
is promising.</p>
<hr />
<p>I have sought in this paper to trace roughly the attitude of the
South toward crime. There is in that attitude much to condemn, but also
something to praise. The tendencies are to-day certainly in the right
direction, but there is a long battle to be fought with prejudice and
inertia before the South will realize that a black criminal is a human
being, to be punished firmly but humanely, with the sole object of
making him a safe member of society, and that a white criminal at large
is a menace and a danger. The greatest difficulty to-day in the way of
reform is this race question. The movement for juvenile reformatories in
Georgia would have succeeded some years ago, in all probability, had not
the argument been used: it is chiefly for the benefit of Negroes. Until
the public opinion of the ruling masses of the South can see that the
prevention of crime among Negroes is just as necessary, just as
profitable, for the whites themselves, as prevention among whites, all
true betterment in courts and prisons will be hindered. Above all, we
must remember that crime is not normal; that the appearance of crime
among Southern Negroes is a symptom of wrong social conditions – of a
stress of life greater than a large part of the community can bear. The
Negro is not naturally criminal; he is usually patient and law-abiding.
If slavery, the convict-lease system, the traffic in criminal labor, the
lack of juvenile reformatories, together with the unfortunate
discrimination and prejudice in other walks of life, have led to that
sort of social protest and revolt which we call crime, then we must look
for remedy in the sane reform of these wrong social conditions, and not
in intimidation, savagery, or the legalized slavery of men.</p>
