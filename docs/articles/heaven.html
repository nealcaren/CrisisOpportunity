<p><em>No recent book has stirred the thoughts and emotions of Negroes
to greater depth and variety than Carl Carl Van Vechten’s novel of Negro
life in Harlem. Mr. Kelly Miller in this article offers evidence of
sociological value, against the rapidly crystallizing notion that Harlem
represents the pinnacle of Negro culture in the United States.—Editor’s
Note</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Senator John Sherman, of Ohio, noticing the exceptional advantages
and advancement of the colored people of the national capital before the
Emancipation Proclamation, called Washington the Negro Heaven. The title
has been undisputed until quite recently when New York laid claim to the
proud distinction. But Washington is not willing to yield the palm
without requiring her rival to prove her claim. Up to the census of
1900, Washington city contained the largest Negro population of any
municipality in the United States, if not in the world. The tide of
Northern migration, stimulated by the World War, has rapidly swollen the
number of Negroes in Northern cities, shifting Washington to the third
or fourth place as to the Negro population. According to the census of
1920, New York contained 152,467 Negroes, Philadelphia, 134,229,
Washington, 109,966, and Chicago, 109,458. The estimated figures for
1925 greatly increase the lead of the Northern cities and throw
Washington still further in the rear.</p>
<p>New York has at present an estimated Negro population of over two
hundred thousand, three-fourths of whom are segregated in the Harlem
District, which constitutes the so-called Negro Heaven. Undoubtedly the
most interesting and spectacular phase of the Negro problem is now
presented in Harlem. The Negro’s problems grow out of his presence. Such
a mass of Negroes suddenly transplanted from Southern towns and villages
and from the open country and thrust into the midst of the greatest and
most progressive city in the world, partaking of its industrial life and
general opportunities, sharing the energy of its rushing current, a part
of, and yet apart from the surrounding social scheme, excites the
liveliest social interest and attention. The outcome of this field of
racial adjustment is bound to be watched with a degree of social
attention which no other point of race contact can at present command.
The New Negro, of whom we have recently heard so much is nothing but the
old Negro exposed to the Harlem environment.</p>
<p>Carl Van Vechten, the well known critic and author of the realistic
school has recently published a novel entitled <em>Nigger Heaven</em>,
which is merely an artistic portrayal of the Harlem Negro, in his gayer
mood for joy and jazz. The mad quest for “kicks” and thrills, the
saturnalia of song, dance and wine, the revelry of the cabaret are
merely outbursts of Negro nature which would break forth at any place
and time under like provocative conditions. The so-called Negro art is
merely the Negro soul turning itself wrong side out for white people to
weep over and laugh at. The Negro life in Harlem is mainly effervescence
and froth without seriousness or solid supporting basis. The riot of
frolic and frivolity is characteristic of Babylon on the verge of
destruction rather than ot Heaven, the blissful abode of tradition.</p>
<p>The Washington Negro occupies a unique place in the scheme of race
relationship which gives this group a peculiar and far reaching social
significance. While New York, Philadelphia and Chicago have a larger
number of Negroes counted by themselves, yet as a percentage of the
total population they are practically negligible. Two hundred thousand
Negroes of New York in the midst of six million whites have no more
relative significance than a single apple in a half bushel basket. On
the other hand, the Negroes in Washington constitute one-fourth of the
total population, and necessarily color and complicate every feature of
the community life. The great metropolitan city plods its accustomed way
unconscious of the relative handful of Negroes and unconcerned about
them, except in their restricted, segregated area. If every Negro should
withdraw over night from the greater New York, nothing would be missed
except the jazz and the blues. But with Washington, it is otherwise. The
atmosphere and attitude of the national capital is the resultant of many
sectional and local components. Here the North and the South meet. The
race feeling is the complex of the two. If the population might be
likened unto a triangle, it could be said to have a Southern base and a
Northern altitude. Socially the Negro is treated according to the
formula of the South; while politically, he is dealt with after the
notion of the North. In order to establish a plausible basis of
political equality, both races were reduced to a political null—on the
theory that all zeroes are equal.</p>
<p>In Washington the Negro labors under the same social disabilities or
disadvantages as in the South, with the exception of the fixity of law.
The federal government cannot afford to vitiate the integrity of the law
to meet the exactions of local prejudice and proscription. The silent
force of custom and tradition obviates that necessity. There are no
jim-crow laws on the federal statute, but there are jim-crow practices
under federal connivance. Separate schools exist in the District of
Columbia rather by common consent and acceptance than by categorical
congressional enactment. There are no separate cars, although sundry
futile attempts have been made to this effect. There are no laws
forbidding the intermarriage of the races; and yet the two races rarely
intermarry. But comprehensively <span class="pagenum">371</span>
speaking the Negroes of the national capital occupy the same sort of
separate social existence as in the South. In public functions involving
semi-social contact, the line of demarcation is sharply marked and
understood. Occasionally a Negro official falls in line to call on the
President at a public levee. Negroes are not accepted as guests in
hotels or as patrons in restaurants, barber shops, theaters, or places
of amusement, except on the basis of separate assignment of seats and
accommodation. The federal government has taken on the spirit and method
of local proscription. Negroes in the civil service are segregated,
either by separate assignment of rooms, or by being given separate desk
assignment in the same room. Mr. William Monroe Trotter, the intrepid
editor of the <em>Boston Guardian</em>, greatly embarrassed President
Woodrow Wilson by confronting him to his face with the charge of
segregating federal employees on the ground of race and color. The press
of the country sided with Mr. Trotter that the practice was
undemocratic, un-American and wrong in principle. But the exposure had
little effect upon the practice. Notwithstanding forced explanations,
evasions and semi-denials of bureau chiefs and heads of department,
segregation continues under Republican and Democratic administrations
alike. The writer was a member of a delegation headed by Mr. Trotter to
protest the continuance of the invidious practice under President
Coolidge. Racial segregation of federal employees was reprobated in
principle. Cautious assurance was given that practice would be checked,
as it could be prudently done, with hope of its ultimate
elimination.</p>
<p>The question of residential segregation is now raging in every city
with a considerable Negro contingent, from Atlantic City to Los Angeles,
and from New York to New Orleans. The District of Columbia has become
the fountain head of this agitation. Attempts to fix legal boundaries of
racial habitation have been estopped by decision of the Supreme Court of
the United States. In all of the large cities of the country the two
races occupy separate residential areas. Public sentiment always finds a
way to enforce its feeling as effectively without the law as with it.
There are no discriminatory laws on the statute books of New York state,
and yet Harlem is as sharply delineated, as if pencil drawn and knife
cut. The Negroes are being relegated to the land of Goshen in all our
great cities, which as completely pens them in to themselves as were the
Jews in the land of Egypt, in the days of the Pharoahs.</p>
<p>The Negro has a habit of falling heir to the fairest portions of the
cities in which he dwells. This is certainly true of the capital of the
nation. The colored population occupies fully a square mile in the
Northwest quadrant, the most favored section, overlooking the Capitol,
Washington Monument and the principal public buildings with the Potomac
River on the rim of the dim horizon. This section is. within easy reach
of the business heart of the city and is traversed by the principal
arteries of</p>
<p>travel and trade. The interlacing broad streets and avenues are lined
with choice shade trees planted in the early years of the city’s
development in harmony with the original design. The beautiful parks,
squares and triangles scattered throughout express the last word in
municipal landscape planning. The whites are now seeking residence in
apartment houses and in remoter suburban subdivisions; but they must
needs traverse the Negro section in going and coming from business
portions of the city or the public offices. Palatial residences built by
the most wealthy and fashionable element a generation ago are now
occupied by Negro owners or tenants.</p>
<p>Thus the Washington Negro, unlike his New York rival for the heavenly
title, is not crowded into seven-story apartment houses, where normal
home life and wholesome social intercourse become all but
impossible.</p>
<p>Washington is the only city in the country that has a Negro elite of
sufficient size to make it a worthwhile social entity. All social
distinction, among black folks as among white, according to the
traditional conceit, is based upon occupation. The Negro learned from
slavery to look down on people who must needs work with the hands and to
idolize and extol those whom circumstances or good fortune lifted above
the necessity of manual toil. His contempt for the poor white man who
must work for a living the same as himself is deep seated and abiding.
The black man’s fondness for seizing upon meaningless forms of
distinction and of exploiting them to a ridiculous degree is well known.
The Negroes of the national capital before the Civil War were mainly
free persons. They were a hard working lot with no more social
distinctions among them than might be expected among a peasant class.
They all worked as waiters, coachmen, barbers, and attendants upon
families of wealth. Besides a few school teachers and preachers, there
were no Negroes in the so-called higher pursuits such as they are
understood today. Colored society with all of its airs and pretensions
was created during the days of reconstruction. These were days of sudden
and swift transformation among black folk. Lucky Negroes were translated
from the corn field to Congress. Negro senators, congressmen,
legislators and officials sprung up like magic. Washington was the
center of the display of all of this suddenly acquired glory and glamor.
The newly made Negro gentility imitated all of the dress and fastidious
manners of the master class from whose sway they had recently been
released and were easily prone to better the instruction. There used to
be a saying in the South: “if you want a thing run into the ground, let
the Negro get a hold of it.” The whole population of the national
capital began to look up to and imitate these artificial standards.</p>
<p>For the first time colored men were given clerkships in the federal
government. These positions became at once a badge of social
distinction. At the same time a system of public schools was inaugurated
which imported Negro teachers from all <span class="pagenum">372</span>
points in the North where good educational advantages had existed.
Picked colored men and women were drawn from all parts of the land by
the political and educational attractions of the national capital. For
the first time, since Jamestown, there were assembled a considerable
body of Negroes who were lifted above the level of manual labor and
domestic service. This group constituted what was known far and wide as
the Washington colored society.</p>
<p>Upon the overthrow of the reconstruction governments in the South,
the political “lame ducks” flocked to the national capital to secure
berths in the clerical service of the government. Practically every
Negro of distinction sought residence or sojourn here. Frederick
Douglass, Senator Bruce, John M. Langston, Governor Pinchback were among
the celebrities who helped to give dignity and tone to the newly formed
social group. At that time Washington had no rival to the title of
“Negro Heaven.”</p>
<p>This sudden political influx and the pretentious regime which it
inaugurated, produced a chasm in the Negro population which two
generations ot temperate judgment and good sense have hardly been able
to efface. Although under the democratizing effect of the public
schools, these arrogant distinctions are gradually fading away, still
the social breach between the masses and the classes of Negroes in
Washington is more pronounced than in any other city of the country.</p>
<p>It requires a pyramidal ordering of society to give exclusiveness
beyond the reach of the multitude. Those who reach the top are looked up
to with admiration, jealousy, covetousness and despair by the masses
below, who finding themselves hopelessly excluded from the charmed
circle, console themselves with the philosophy of the fox who always
describes the high hanging grapes as sour. This bad eminence may rest
upon blood and birth, as in the South, upon culture and tradition, as in
New England, or upon ostentatious wealth among the parvenues of recent
riches. But with the New York Negroes there is no traceable line of
differentiation. The bootblack, the bootlegger, the gambler, the dancer,
the songster, the woman of good looks and glad rags—whosoever will, mav
come.</p>
<p>The Washington Negro has the only complete school system in the
country practically under his own control. Three out of nine members of
the Board of Education are assigned to the colored race, who are
supposed to see to it that the colored branch of the system suffers no
disadvantage in comparison with the whites. The schools are divided into
two grand divisions—white and colored in harmony with the understood and
accepted policy of the community. The superintendent is a white man
under whose general supervision both divisions are operated on equal
footing and along parallel lines. The first colored Assistant
Superintendent is in charge of all colored schools and has complete
original jurisdiction in appointment, promotion and assignment of eight
hundred teachers and officials.</p>
<p>The colored teachers and officials have the same rank and pay as do
the whites of corresponding grade and work. The courses of study and
standards of instruction are uniform throughout. In providing for school
buildings, appointments and facilities, there is supposed to be
absolutely no discrimination. There is an understanding in Congress that
the colored schools shall receive their full proportion of
appropriations for school purposes. Fifteen thousand Negro children sit
at the feet of these eight hundred teachers. The Washington public
school system is justly famous throughout the country. The Negro
division contributes its full share to this national distinction. The
colored high and normal schools enroll over three thousand pupils above
the eight grade level. This number of secondary pupils cannot be
approximated in any other city—not even New York, Philadelphia and
Chicago, with a much larger total Negro population. The faculties of
these high and normal schools are recruited by graduates from Harvard,
Yale, Columbia, and indeed from every college and University in the
North and West which does not limit the opportunity for education and
culture to considerations of race and color. There are four women
doctors of philosophy from Yale, Harvard, Chicago and from the Sorbonne
of Paris, France, in the number. I believe that these are the only Negro
women doctors of philosophy from institutions of the highest standing,
in the United States.</p>
<p>The annual competitive drill where a thousand male cadets under fifty
Negro officers display their military skill before the assembled city
constitutes a social event, not paralleled in America, if in the
world.</p>
<p>Howard University, the largest and best equipped institution for the
higher and professional education of the colored race, is located at the
national capital. This institution has over two thousand students drawn
from all over the United States and from foreign lands pursuing courses
which will fit them to stand in the high places of leadership and
authority. The faculty of this institution comprises one hundred and
fifty professors and instructors mainly of the colored race who along
all lines of the arts and sciences as well as in the technical and
professional pursuits dispense wisdom and technique to this multitude of
ambitious youth who hunger and thirst after knowledge, Howard University
and the public schools together center about the city of Washington the
cream of the intelligensia of the Negro race.</p>
<p>The Freedmens Hospital, acknowledged to be the most complete and best
equipped institution of its kind between Baltimore and New Orleans is in
close physical juxtaposition and professional relationship with Howard
University. This institution is in charge of a colored surgeon-in-chief
with a highly skilled staff of assistants under him.</p>
<p>A residuum of the by-gone political glory still lingers in the
national capital. Washington is still the headquarters of the Negro
politician, although like Othello, he finds that his occupation is all
but <span class="pagenum">373</span> gone. A few officials are still
left, with many more who call but are not chosen. The tradition of
senators, representatives, registers, recorders, and other high
officials is still here. There are many thousand Negroes on the federal
pay roll, which of itself, alligns them with the preferred class among
the race.</p>
<p>The Negroes of Washington have reached the point of complete
professional self sufficiency. Howard University has turned out an army
of physicians, lawyers, teachers and clergymen, who never leave the city
as long as there is the slightest likelihood of local need of their
services. A white physician of Negro patients is almost as unusual as a
white minister of a Negro parishioner. Negro lawyers in the main look
after the needs of the Negro client, while the preacher and the teacher
have a complete monopoly.</p>
<p>To these may be added an increasing number of successful business men
who are beginning to see and to seize the immense business opportunity
wrapped up in the needs and necessities of so great a mass of Negro
flesh and blood.</p>
<p>So great a body of Negroes, lifted by occupation above the level of
ten-fingered service constitute an element of social importance which
neither New York nor any other community can hope to approximate.</p>
<p>Washington has the fault or the misfortune of all groups of Negroes
everywhere. There is no middle class. The connecting link is missing.
There are no local productive industries in the District of Columbia.
Realtors and local merchants constitute the sum total of business men.
The Negro only in limited numbers enters these lines. The great bulk,
except the favored persons above described, are common laborers or
domestic servants. The social maladjustment between the upper and the
lower levels of position and occupation frustrates concerted action and
greatly retards the common progress.</p>
<p>But in Washington, as in New York, the proletariat must be
entertained. Theaters, movie houses, dance halls and cabarets are
springing up everywhere. There is no lack of facilities for enjoyment on
the part of any social element. There is little or no race friction
here, of which any considerable portion of the community is conscious
for any considerable proportion of the time. Once in a great while some
outbreak or agitation arouses the people to self-consciousness; but like
a hasty spark, they straightway grow cold again. There is nothing that
interferes with the uniformity of a good time among all classes.</p>
<p>The Negro race in every mood is prone to the enjoyment and the
delights of life. Moments of grave reflection over the hardships and
ills of his lot are quickly forgotten in anticipation of a good
time.</p>
<p>Washington is the social capital of the Negro race. Social
celebrities from all parts of the country find fulfillment of their
highest ambition to shine at some great function in the national
capital. Every four years a president of the United States is
inaugurated. The occasion is usually featured by an inaugural ball.
Although the Negroes may have little cause for jubilation over the
incoming administration, they usually have two or three inaugural balls,
whereas the whites are satisfied with one. The minor inaugural
receptions are too numerous to enumerate. On such occasions, the Negroes
usually take option on every available dance hall or place of amusement,
placing the whites at a great disadvantage. The writer recalls that on
the very night when the fate of the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill was hanging
in the balance in the Senate Committee, the Negroes were fiddling and
dancing the time away in every dance house in Washington in celebration
of the Thanksgiving festivities. At the time of President Coolidge’s
inauguration, I counted twenty placards within a few blocks announcing
as many different inauguration receptions. I have even seen the
announcement of a dance in an undertaker’s window. Who says the Negro
feels that his is an oppressed race?</p>
<p>The capital city furnishes the best opportunity and facilities for
the expression of the Negros innate gayety of soul. Washington is still
the Negro’s Heaven, and it will be many a moon before Harlem will be
able to take away her scepter.</p>
