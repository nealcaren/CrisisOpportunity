<p class="subtitle">Forgotten sociology.</p>



<ul>
<li><span class="smallcaps">Crisis <em>&amp;</em> Opportunity</span> is
a compilation of largely-forgotten works by Black sociologists from the
early twentieth century. These articles offer valuable insights into the
evolution of sociology and its relevance to current social issues. The
selected works have been previously inaccessible or ignored, and their
republication serves as an effort to promote a more diverse and
inclusive understanding of the discipline’s history.</li>
<li>Articles published here reflect the interdisciplinary nature of
early sociology, with sociologists publishing an a variety of outlets
and scholars not formally trained in sociology publishing work in
sociology journals or in dialogue with sociologists.<br />
</li>
<li>The name <span class="smallcaps">Crisis <em>&amp;</em>
Opportunity</span> is inspired by two prominent periodicals in the early
part of the twentieth century edited by Black sociologists. W.E. B. Du
Bois founded <em>The Crisis</em>, the official journal of the NAACP, in
1910 and was its editor until 1934. Charles S. Johnson, sociologist and
later president of Fisk University, edited <em>Opportunity</em>, the
official journal of the National Urban League, founded by George Edmund
Haynes, later a sociology professor at Fisk. “The Journal of Negro
Education” also emerged as a leading outlet for Black scholars in the
social sciences to write on a diverse range of topics. This journal was
founded in 1932 by Charles Henry Thompson, an educational psychologist
at Howard University.</li>
<li>Given the prominence of W.E. B. Du Bois today, this compilation
prioritizes republishing works by lesser-known Black scholars.</li>
<li>Artwork on the homepage is created with variations on the prompt
“abstract Harlem renaissance woodcut style of Aaron Douglas” using
OpenAI’s Dall-E.</li>
<li>Each of the works on this site is believed to be in the public
domain. Feel free to copy, share, repurpose, and remix. All works
published more than 95 years ago are now in the public domain, and many
academic articles from the 1930s and 1940s did not have their copyright
renewed. If you think we’ve made a mistake, let <a
