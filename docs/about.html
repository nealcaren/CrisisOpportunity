<p class="subtitle">Forgotten sociology.</p>



<p> </p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Crisis <em>&amp;</em> Opportunity</span> is a
compilation of largely-forgotten works by Black scholars from the early
decades of sociology. These articles offer valuable insights into the
evolution of sociology and its relevance to current social issues. Many
of the selected works have been previously hard to access or ignored,
and their republication aims to promote a more diverse and inclusive
understanding of the discipline’s history.</p>
<p>Articles printed in <span class="smallcaps">Crisis <em>&amp;</em>
Opportunity</span> reflect the interdisciplinary nature of early
sociology, with sociologists publishing in a variety of outlets and
scholars not formally trained in sociology publishing work in sociology
journals or in dialogue with sociologists.</p>
<p>For an overview of Black sociology during this period, see Earl
Wright’s <em><a
href="https://ucincinnatipress.uc.edu/9781947602571/jim-crow-sociology/">Jim
Crow Sociology: The Black and Southern Roots of American
Sociology</a></em> and Alford A. Young, Jr. and Donald R. Deskins, Jr.’s
“<a
href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.445">Early
Traditions of African-American Sociological Thought</a>.”</p>
<p>The name <span class="smallcaps">Crisis <em>&amp;</em>
Opportunity</span> is inspired by two prominent periodicals founded and
edited by Black sociologists in the early part of the twentieth century.
W.E. B. Du Bois founded <em>The Crisis</em>, the official journal of the
NAACP, in 1910 and was its editor until 1934. Charles S. Johnson,
sociologist and later president of Fisk University, edited
<em>Opportunity</em>, the official journal of the National Urban League,
founded by George Edmund Haynes, later a sociology professor at
Fisk.</p>
<p>Given the prominence of W.E. B. Du Bois today, this compilation
prioritizes republishing works by other Black scholars.</p>
<p>Artwork on the main page was created using OpenAI’s Dall-E with
variations on the prompt “abstract Harlem Renaissance woodcut style of
Aaron Douglas” or by Dall-E generating images based on specific artwork.
In the later cases, the original work is credited when you hover over
the image.</p>
<p>Each article on this site is believed to be in the public domain.

than 95 years ago are now in the public domain, and many academic
articles from the 1930s and 1940s did not have their copyright renewed.
