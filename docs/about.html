<p class="subtitle">Forgotten sociology.</p>



<ul>
<li><span class="smallcaps">Crisis <em>&amp;</em> Opportunity</span>
seeks to reprint foundational work in the field of sociology. The focus
is on articles that can provide valuable insights both into
understanding the development of sociology but also our analysis of
contemporary social issues.<br />
</li>
<li>The name <span class="smallcaps">Crisis <em>&amp;</em>
Opportunity</span> is inspired by two prominent periodicals in the early
part of the twentieth century edited by Black sociologists. W.E. B. Du
Bois founded <em>The Crisis</em>, the official journal of the NAACP, in
1910 and was its editor until 1934. Charles S. Johnson, sociologist and
later president of Fisk University, edited <em>Opportunity</em>, the
official journal of the National Urban League, founded by George Edmund
Haynes, later a sociology professor at Fisk.</li>
<li>Artwork on the homepage is created with variations on the prompt
“abstract Harlem renaissance woodcut style of Aaron Douglas” using
