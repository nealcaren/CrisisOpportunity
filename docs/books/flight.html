            <div class="book-description">
                <p>Here is the season's most daring and provocative offering, a tale etched with the sharp reality of that most vexing question of our time. It is the story of Mimi Daquin, a woman of rare beauty and spirit, born into the languid grace of New Orleans’ Creole parlors. Yet, destiny sweeps her into the harsh, unforgiving clamor of Atlanta and finally to the glittering heights of New York society. Possessing a complexion that belies her ancestry, she stands at a perilous crossroads where she might choose to be anyone she desires—except, perhaps, her true self.</p>

                <p>In this poignant drama of identity and the human heart, Mimi embarks upon a "flight" into the white world, seeking liberty from the constraints placed upon her race. But as she navigates the parlors of the elite, she is haunted by the question of whether such freedom is worth the terrible price of denying her own heritage. It is a searching exploration of the soul of a woman torn between two worlds, challenging the reader to decide if the masquerade of passing is a triumph or a tragedy.</p>

                <p>The author, Mr. Walter F. White, is uniquely qualified to pen this pitilessly realistic narrative. A graduate of Atlanta University and currently serving as the Assistant Secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Mr. White has traveled extensively through the South investigating the conditions of his people. His previous novel, <em>The Fire in the Flint</em> (1924), was hailed as a courageous document of American life. In <em>Flight</em>, he turns his keen eye once again to the complexities of the race problem with a story that bears the unmistakable stamp of truth.</p>
